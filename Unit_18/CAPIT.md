CAPIT, from the Latin word for “head,” caput, turns up in some important places. The head of a ship
is its captain, and the capital of a state or country is where the “head of state” works. A capital letter
stands head and shoulders above a lowercase letter, as well as at the head (beginning) of a sentence.

and open competition in a free market. 

 An economic system based on private ownership, private decisions,

•  In  the  1980s,  the  leaders  of  the  free  world  had  faith  that  capitalism  and  a  free-market  economy
would solve all our problems. 

Capital  is  wealth—that  is,  money  and  goods—that's  used  to  produce  more  wealth.  Capitalism  is
practiced  enthusiastically  by  capitalists,  people  who  use  capital  to  increase  production  and  make
more goods and money. Capitalism works by encouraging competition in a fair and open market. Its
opposite is often said to be socialism. Where a capitalist economy encourages private actions and
ownership, socialism prefers public or government ownership and control of parts of the economy. In
a pure capitalist system, there would be no public schools or public parks, no government programs
such as Social Security and Medicare, and maybe not even any public highways or police. In a pure
socialist system, there wouldn't be any private corporations. In other words, there's just about no such
thing as pure capitalism or pure socialism in the modern world.

- [[capitulate]] 

 To surrender or stop resisting; give up. 

• At 2:00 a.m. the last three senators finally capitulated, allowing the bill to move forward. 

Capitulation  often  refers  to  surrender  on  the  battlefield.  Originally  it  only  referred  to  surrender
according  to  an  agreement,  though  that  part  of  the  meaning  is  often  absent.  Today  a  teacher  can
capitulate to her students' cries of protest against a homework assignment, or a father can capitulate to
his  kids'  pleas  to  stop  for  ice  cream,  when  the  only  terms  of  the  agreement  are  that  they'll  stop
complaining.

- [[decapitate]] 

 (1) To cut off the head; behead. (2) To destroy or make useless. 

•  The  leaders  of  the  uprising  were  decapitated,  and  their  heads  were  mounted  on  long  poles  on
London Bridge as a warning to the people. 

Decapitation is a quick and fairly painless way to go, so it was once considered suitable only for
nobles like Sir Walter Raleigh, Mary Queen of Scots, and two of Henry VIII's unfortunate wives. The
invention of the guillotine in the 18th century was meant to make execution swifter and more painless
than hanging or a badly aimed blow by the executioner's sword.

- [[recapitulate]] 

 To repeat or summarize the most important points or stages. 

• At the end of his talk, the president carefully recapitulated the main points in order. 

Capitulation  originally  meant  the  organizing  of  material  under  headings.  So  recapitulation  usually
involves the gathering of the main ideas in a brief summary. But a recapitulation may be a complete
restatement as well. In many pieces of classical music, the recapitulation, or recap, is the long final
section of a movement, where the earlier music is restated in the main key.

- ANTHROP  comes  from  the  Greek  word  for  “human  being.”  So  an  anthropomorphic  god,  such  as
