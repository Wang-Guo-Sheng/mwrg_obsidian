- ANTHROP  comes  from  the  Greek  word  for  “human  being.”  So  an  anthropomorphic  god,  such  as
Zeus  or  Athena,  basically  looks  and  acts  like  a  human.  And  in  Aesop's  fables  and  many  animated
cartoons, animals are usually anthropomorphized  and  behave  exactly  like  furry,  four-legged  human
beings.

- [[anthropoid]] 

 Any of several large, tailless apes. 

• The chimpanzees, gorillas, orangutans, gibbons, and bonobos are all classified as anthropoids. 

With its suffix -oid, meaning “resembling,” the word anthropoid means literally “resembling a human
being.”  Anthropoid  apes  are  so  called  because  they  resemble  humans  more  closely  than  do  other
primates such as monkeys and lemurs. Some even spend a good deal of time walking on their hind
legs.  Anthropoids  are,  of  course,  highly  intelligent  (though  maybe  no  more  so  than  many  monkeys),
and  some  of  them  use  sticks  and  stones  as  tools.  (But  if  you  call  someone  an  anthropoid,  you're
probably not complimenting his intelligence.)

- [[anthropology]] 

 The science and study of human beings. 

• By studying the cultures of primitive peoples, anthropology may give us a better understanding of
our own culture. 

Anthropologists, those who study the whys and wherefores of human existence, today look not only at
the tribes of the Amazon but also at the neighborhoods of Brooklyn or Santa Monica. Every group and
every culture now seems to be possible material for anthropology. Some anthropologists specialize in
the study of human evolution, some study human language, some study archaeology, and some study
human culture through the ages. Unlike historians, they tend to focus less on what has been recorded in
writings than on what can be discovered in other ways.

- [[misanthropic]] 

 Hating or distrusting humans. 

• Few characters in literature are more misanthropic than Ebenezer Scrooge, who cares for nothing
but money. 

Jonathan Swift was famous for the misanthropy of works such as Gulliver's Travels which make fun
of all kinds of human foolishness. But in spite of his apparent misanthropic attitude, he spent a third of
his income on founding a hospital and another third on other charities—certainly not the acts of a true
misanthrope. Today we often use synonyms such as cynic and grinch for misanthropic types—while
hoping we don't meet too many of them.

- [[lycanthropy]] 
wolf through witchcraft or magic. 

 (1) A delusion that one has become a wolf. (2) Transformation into a

•  The  local  farmers  avoided  the  residents  of  the  village  in  the  next  valley,  who  had  long  been
suspected of grave robbing and lycanthropy. 

The  Greek  word  for  “wolf,”  lykos,  combines  with  the  anthro-  root  to  produce  the  meaning
“wolfman.” In European folklore, dating back to the ancient Greeks and Romans, there are men who
change  into  wolves  at  night  and  devour  animals,  people,  or  graveyard  corpses  before  returning  to
human form at dawn. Werewolves, or lycanthropes, may be evil and possessed by the devil, or may
instead  be  the  victims  of  a  werewolf  bite  and  thereby  cursed  to  change  into  wolf  form  at  the  full
moon. The werewolf's evil intention is shown by its eating only part of the animal or corpse, rather
than all of it like a truly hungry wolf.
