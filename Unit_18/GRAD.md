- GRAD comes from the Latin noun gradus, “step” or “degree,” and the verb gradi, “to step, walk.” A
grade is a step up or down on a scale of some kind, and a gradual change takes place in small steps.

- [[gradation]] 

 (1) A series made up of successive stages. (2) A step in an ordered scale.

• In the fall, the leaves show gradations of color from deepest red to brightest yellow. 

In  the  Boy  Scouts,  gradations  of  rank  move  upward  from  Tenderfoot  to  Eagle  Scout.  A  violin  or  a
voice  can  produce  gradations  of  musical  pitch  too  small  to  appear  in  written  music.  In  the  18th
century Jonathan Swift could even write of “the several kinds and gradations of laughter, which ladies
must daily practice by the looking-glass.”

• They had feared for years that television was degrading the mental capacities of their children. 

In Shakespeare's King Lear, the old king is degraded by the daughters he has given his kingdom to. He
finds  it  degrading,  for  instance,  when  the  number  of  his  guards  is  reduced  from  100  to  25.  His
degradation seems complete when, after going mad, he's reduced to living in the wilderness. As you
can see, degrade is often a synonym for humiliate.

- [[gradient]] 

 (1) Slope, grade. (2) A continuous change in measure, activity, or substance. 

• Steep temperature gradients in the atmosphere are usually associated with unstable conditions. 

Any  slope  can  be  called  a  gradient.  In  the  interstate  highway  system,  the  maximum  gradient  is  6
percent; in other words, the highway may never ascend more than 6 vertical feet over a distance of
100 feet. Any rate of change that's shown on a graph may have a sloped gradient. Suppose the graph's
horizontal axis shows the passage of time and its vertical axis shows some activity; if the activity is
happening  very  fast,  then  the  gradient  of  the  line  on  the  graph  will  be  steep,  but  if  it's  slow  the
gradient will be gentle, or gradual.

- [[retrograde]]

 (1) Moving or performed in a direction that is backward or opposite to

•  For  the  government  to  cover  up  the  findings  of  its  scientific  research  institutes  was  clearly  a
retrograde step. 

Retrograde  describes  backwardness  of  one  kind  or  another.  If  a  country  decided  to  go  back  to
amputating the limbs of criminals, we might call that policy retrograde. A retrograde view of women
might be one that sees them basically as housekeepers. Mars and Jupiter show retrograde (backward)
motion  at  some  stages  of  their  orbits,  though  this  is  only  because  of  the  way  we  see  them  from  the
earth, not because of any real backward movement.

- REG, from the Latin regula, meaning “rule,” has given us many English words. Something regular
