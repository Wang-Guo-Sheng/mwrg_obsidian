- DYNAM comes from the Greek dynamis, meaning “power.” A dyne is a unit used in measuring force;
an  instrument  that  measures  force  is  called  a  dynamometer.  And  when  Alfred  Nobel  invented  a
powerful explosive in 1867, he named it dynamite.

- [[dynamic]] 
active and changing; energetic or forceful. 

  (1)  Relating  to  physical  force  or  energy.  (2)  Continuously  and  productively

•  The  situation  has  entered  a  dynamic  phase,  and  what  we  knew  about  it  last  week  has  changed
considerably by now. 

Dynamic is the opposite of static, which means “not moving or active.” So all living languages, for
example, are dynamic rather than static, changing from year to year even when they don't appear to be.
A bustling commercial city like Hong Kong is intensely dynamic, constantly changing and adapting. A
dynamic  relationship—for  example,  the  relationship  between  housing  values  and  interest  rates
charged by banks—is one that changes all the time. Unfortunately, the word has been used so much by
advertisers that we tend to forget its basic meaning.

- [[dynamo]] 
A forceful, energetic person. 

 (1) A power generator, especially one that produces direct electric current. (2)

•  Even  as  they  entered  the  power  plant,  the  roar  of  the  water  covered  the  sound  of  the  immense
dynamos. 

The  dynamo  was  introduced  in  1832  to  produce  electricity  for  commercial  use.  Like  all  later
generators,  the  original  dynamos  changed  mechanical  energy  (produced  by  steam,  which  was  itself
produced by burning coal) into electricity. The word is less used today than it once was, since it's
often  applied  only  to  generators  that  produced  direct  electric  current  (DC)  rather  than  alternating
current (AC), which is now the standard. A human dynamo is a person who seems to have unlimited
energy,  such  as  New  York's  legendary  mayor  Fiorello  La  Guardia,  whose  forcefulness  and  vigor
matched that of his intensely dynamic city.

- [[aerodynamics]] 
 (1) A science that studies the movement of gases such as air and
the way that objects move through such gases. (2) The qualities of an object that affect how easily it is
able to move through the air. 

• Early automobile designs were based on the boxlike carriages drawn by horses, back when no one
was even thinking about aerodynamics. 

Aerodynamics began as a science around the time of the Wright brothers' first manned flights. Since
then, it's become important to the building not only of aircraft and automobiles but also of rockets and
missiles,  trains,  ships,  and  even  such  structures  as  bridges  and  tall  buildings,  which  often  have  to
withstand strong winds. An aerodynamic  vehicle  is  one  whose  design  helps  it  achieve  the  greatest
speed  and  most  efficient  use  of  fuel.  But  although  we  might  casually  call  any  sleek  car  design
aerodynamic, true aerodynamics is practiced not by artistic product designers but instead by highly
trained scientists, and many people's lives depend on their work.

- [[hydrodynamic]] 
the forces that act on bodies surrounded by fluids. 

 Having to do with the science that studies fluids in motion and

• Building levees to contain a flood presents complicated hydrodynamic problems. 

Bernoulli's  principle,  which  is  basic  to  the  science  of  hydrodynamics,  says  that  the  faster  a  fluid
substance  flows,  the  less  outward  pressure  it  exerts.  It  shows  the  close  relationship  between
hydrodynamics and aerodynamics (which deals with the movement of air and other gases), since it
can  partly  explain  how  air  will  “lift”  an  airplane  by  the  way  it  flows  over  the  wings,  and  how  a
spoiler  helps  keep  a  race  car's  wheels  pressed  to  the  ground  as  it  accelerates.  Hydrodynamics  is
sometimes applied today in studying the surface of the planets and even the stars. As used informally
by boaters, hydrodynamic often means “hydrodynamically efficient.”
