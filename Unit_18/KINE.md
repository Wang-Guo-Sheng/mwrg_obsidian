- KINE  comes  from  the  Greek  word  kinesis,  meaning  “movement.”  Kinetic  energy  is  the  energy  of
motion (as opposed to potential energy, the kind of energy held by a stretched elastic band). Kinetic
art is art that has moving parts, such as Alexander Calder's famous mobiles. And cinema, the art of
moving pictures, actually comes from the same kine- [[root]] as well.

- [[kinesiology]] 

 The scientific study of human movement. 

• With a kinesiology degree in hand, she landed a job as a rehab therapist for patients following heart
surgery. 

Kinesiologists  study  the  acquisition  of  motor  skills,  the  mechanical  aspects  of  movement,  and  the
body's responses to physical activity. A kinesiologist may work in a public-school fitness program,
design exercise programs for people with and without disabilities, or work with patients recovering
from disease, accidents, and surgery. As a field of research, kinesiology focuses particularly on the
mechanics of muscular activity.

- [[hyperkinetic]] 
by fast-paced or frantic activity. 

  (1)  Relating  to  or  affected  with  hyperactivity.  (2)  Characterized

• Noises Off is a hyperkinetic stage farce that moves at a breathless pace for a full hour and a half. 

Since the prefix hyper- [[means]] “above, beyond” (see HYPER), hyperkinetic describes motion beyond
the  usual.  The  word  is  usually  applied  to  children,  and  often  describes  the  condition  of  almost
uncontrollable  activity  or  muscular  movements  called  attention-deficit/hyperactivity  disorder
(ADHD). Kids with ADHD are usually not just hyperkinetic but also inattentive, forgetful, and flighty.
Though they're often treated with drugs, many experts believe there are better ways of dealing with
the problem. Lots of people now shorten both hyperactive and hyperkinetic to simply hyper (“He's
been hyper all morning”), but usually don't mean it too seriously.

- [[kinescope]] 

 A motion picture made from an image on a picture tube. 

• In the archives she turned up several kinescopes of Ernie Kovacs's 1950s show, which she thought
had been dumped into New York Harbor decades ago. 

Kinescope, originally a trademark for the cathode-ray tube in a TV, later became the name for a film
of a TV screen showing a live broadcast. In order for a program to be seen beyond New York in the
early days of TV, a kinescope had to be shipped from station to station. Though grainy and fuzzy, these
were  for  a  time  the  only  way  of  capturing  live  shows.  But  in  1951  Desi  Arnaz  and  Lucille  Ball
decided to film their comedy show rather than to broadcast it live, and in a few years live broadcast
comedy and drama had vanished from the airwaves.

- [[telekinesis]] 
by the exercise of an occult power. 

 The movement of objects without contact or other physical means, as

• Fascinated by telekinesis as a boy, he'd spent hours in his room trying to push a pencil off the table
using only his mind. 

Tele-  in  Greek  means  “far  off”  (see  TELE).  The  eternally  appealing  idea  of  moving  an  object
remotely,  using  only  psychic  powers,  has  had  a  long  life  in  films,  TV  shows,  stories  and  novels,
video games, and comics. But although some researchers believe in the existence of telekinesis (also
known as psychokinesis), most scientists believe that any reported experiences have been the result
of fraud, wishful thinking, or naturally explainable events.

- DYNAM comes from the Greek dynamis, meaning “power.” A dyne is a unit used in measuring force;
