- QUINT comes from the Latin word meaning “five.” Quintuplets are babies that come in sets of five;
about 60 U.S. families increase in size by that number every year.

- [[quincentennial]] 

 A 500th anniversary, or the celebration of such an event. 

• In 1992 Americans celebrated the quincentennial of Christopher Columbus's first voyage to the New
World. 

The  United  States  is  such  a  young  country  that  it  will  be  quite  some  time  before  we  reach  our
quincentennial  as  a  nation:  2276  A.D.,  to  be  exact.  Some  American  cities  will  celebrate  their
quincentennials long before that, but even St. Augustine, Florida, the nation's oldest city, will have to
wait  until  2065.  Meanwhile,  many  young  people  can  look  forward  happily  to  our  national
tricentennial in 2076; and their grandchildren may be around for our quadricentennial in 2176.

- [[quintessential]] 

 Representing the purest or most perfect example of something. 

• As a boy, he had thought of steak, eggs, and home fries as the quintessential Saturday breakfast. 

The philosophers and scientists of the ancient world and the Middle Ages believed that the world we
inhabit  was  entirely  made  up  of  four  elements:  earth,  air,  fire,  and  water.  Aristotle  added  a  fifth
element,  the  aether  or  ether,  by  which  he  meant  the  material  that  fills  the  rest  of  space,  mostly
invisibly but sometimes taking the form of stars and planets. Many writers described the element as a
kind  of  invisible  light  or  fire.  In  the  Middle  Ages,  it  was  referred  to  as  the  quinta essentia  (“fifth
element”).  It  isn't  surprising  that  the  quinta  essentia  came  to  stand  for  anything  so  perfect  that  it
seemed  to  surpass  the  limitations  of  earth.  Today  we  generally  use  quintessential  rather  freely  to
describe just about anything that represents the best of its kind.

- [[quintet]] 
the performers of a quintet or a basketball team. 

 (1) A musical piece for five instruments or voices. (2) A group of five, such as

• The team's five starters are considered one of the most talented quintets in professional basketball. 

A  classical  quintet  is  usually  written  for  strings  (usually  two  violins,  two  violas,  and  a  cello)  or
woodwinds  (flute,  oboe,  clarinet,  bassoon,  and  horn),  but  brass  quintets  (two  trumpets,  horn,
trombone, and tuba) have also become popular in North America recently. In jazz, Miles Davis led
two famous quintets. In pop music, the Miracles, the Temptations, and the Jackson 5 were immensely
popular  vocal  quintets.  In  rock,  one  of  the  most  common  instrumental  lineups  has  been  a  quintet
consisting  of  two  guitars,  a  bass,  a  keyboard,  and  drums;  famous  rock  quintets  have  included  the
Grateful Dead and the Beach Boys.

- [[quintile]] 
distributed classes, or one of these classes. 

  One  or  another  of  the  values  that  divide  a  tested  population  into  five  evenly

• According to the tests, their one-year-old boy ranks high in the second quintile for motor skills. 

Americans  love  statistics  about  themselves,  whether  they  inform  us  about  our  income,  ice-cream
consumption, or trash production. And any such rating can be divided into fifths, or quintiles. The fifth
or lowest quintile would include the 20 percent of the population who make the least money or eat the
least  ice  cream  or  generate  the  least  trash,  and  the  first  quintile  would  include  the  20  percent  who
make, eat, or generate the most.
