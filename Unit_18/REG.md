- REG, from the Latin regula, meaning “rule,” has given us many English words. Something regular
follows  a  rule  of  some  kind,  even  if  it's  just  a  law  of  nature.  A  regime  can  be  a  form  of  rule  or
government. To regulate an industry means to make and enforce rules, or regulations, for it; removing
such rules is called deregulation.

- [[regimen]] 

 A regular course of treatment, usually involving food, exercise, or medicine. 

•  As  part  of  his  training  regimen,  he  was  now  swimming  two  miles,  running  seven  miles,  and
bicycling 15 miles every day. 

Americans love self-improvement, so they're constantly adopting regimens: skin-care regimens, low-
cholesterol regimens, weight-loss regimens, and the like. A course of medication may be complicated
enough  to  deserve  the  name  regimen,  and  a  rehab  regimen  may  require  having  your  activities
monitored  at  a  treatment  center.  Mental  regimens  can  also  be  valuable;  researchers  are  finding  that
minds that get the most exercise seem to last the longest.

- [[interregnum]] 
  (1)  The  time  during  which  a  throne  is  vacant  between  two
successive  reigns  or  regimes.  (2)  A  period  during  which  the  normal  functions  of  government  or
control are suspended. 

• During the weeklong interregnum between the CEO's death and the appointment of a new CEO, she
felt that she was really running the whole show. 

Every time a pope dies, there's an interregnum period before a new one is elected by the cardinals. In
most  democratic  systems,  however,  the  law  specifies  who  should  take  office  when  a  president  or
prime  minister  dies  unexpectedly,  and  since  the  power  usually  passes  automatically,  there's  no  true
interregnum.  The  question  of  succession—that  is,  of  who  should  take  over  when  a  country's  leader
dies—has often presented huge problems for countries that lacked a constitution, and in monarchies it
hasn't always been clear who should become king or queen when a monarch dies. The interregnum
following the death of Edward VI in 1553, for instance, was briefly suspended when Lady Jane Grey
was installed as Queen; nine days later she was replaced by Mary Tudor, who sent her straight to the
Tower of London.

- [[regalia]] 

 (1) The emblems and symbols of royalty. (2) Special or official dress. 

• The governor seems to enjoy life in the governor's mansion and all the regalia of office more than
actually doing his job. 

Just  as  regal  describes  a  king  or  queen—that  is,  a  ruler—regalia  originally  meant  the  things,  and
especially  the  dress  and  decoration,  that  belong  exclusively  to  a  monarch.  The  British  monarchy's
regalia  include  the  crown  jewels  (crown,  scepter,  orb,  sword,  etc.)  that  lend  luster  to  royal
coronations. Academic regalia—the caps, gowns, and hoods worn by students receiving their degrees
—link institutions to their past by preserving the dress worn at universities since their beginnings in
the Middle Ages, when long hooded robes were needed for warmth.

- [[regency]] 
queen. 

 A government or period of time in which a regent rules in place of a king or

• Since the future king was only four when Louis XIV died, France spent eight years under a regency
before he took the throne at 13 as Louis XV. 

In Britain, the years from the time when George III was declared insane until his death (1811–1820)
are known as the Regency period, since in these years his son, the future George IV, served as Prince
Regent, or acting monarch. (Sometimes the term covers the period up to the end of George IV's own
reign  in  1830.)  The  Regency  is  remembered  for  its  elegant  architecture  and  fashions,  its  literature
(especially the works of Jane Austen), and its politics. Today hotels, furniture, and businesses on both
sides  of  the  Atlantic  carry  the  name  “Regency”  to  identify  with  the  period's  style,  and  hundreds  of
modern  romance  novels—called  simply  “Regencies”—have  been  set  in  the  period.  Though  there
have been dozens of European regencies over the centuries, for Americans today there seems to be
only one Regency.
