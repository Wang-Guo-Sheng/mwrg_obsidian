- CRIT comes from a Greek verb that means “to judge” or “to decide.” So a film critic judges a movie
and tells us what's good or bad about it. Her critical opinion may convince us not to go, or we may
overlook any negative criticism and see it anyway.

- [[criterion]] 

 A standard by which a judgment or decision is made. 

•  He's  one  of  those  readers  whose  main  criterion  for  liking  a  book  is  whether  it  confirms  his
prejudices. 

One person's principal criterion for a new car may be its gas mileage, while someone else's may be
whether it has room for four children. When filling a job opening, employers usually look for several
criteria (notice the plural form) in the applicants; and when college admissions officers are reading
student applications, they likewise always keep a few basic criteria in mind. And when interviewing
an applicant, one criterion for both the employer and the admissions officer might include the size of
the applicant's vocabulary!

- [[critique]] 

 A judgment or evaluation, especially a rating or discussion of merits and faults. 

• Whenever he reads his latest story in the fiction-writing seminar, one of the other students always
delivers a nasty critique. 

Even though criticize means to judge something negatively, a critique can be completely positive—or
completely negative. Usually it's somewhere in between. When a paper of yours receives a critique
from a teacher, you should read it carefully, and then reread it; getting mad or offended is the worst
way to react. Critique is often a verb as well. Thus, writers and artists often form groups solely to
critique each other's work, and scientific articles frequently get critiqued in letters to the editor in the
following issue of the journal.

- [[hypercritical]] 

 Overly critical. 

• Most teachers do their best to correct their students' mistakes without seeming hypercritical. 

The important prefix hyper- [[means]] “excessive” or “beyond” (see HYPER), so hypercritical means
basically “too fussy.” In TV and film comedies, the mother-in-law is just about always hypercritical,
since the person her child married is never good enough for her. But other parents, spouses, and even
children can be just as bad, so we should all be careful. If your father asks what you think of his new
experimental meatloaf and you say it needs a pinch of oregano, you're being constructive; if you say
he should cut down on the sawdust next time, you're probably being hypercritical.

- [[hematocrit]] 

 The ratio of the volume of red blood cells to whole blood. 

• The latest blood test had revealed that her hematocrit had risen considerably and was almost back to
normal. 

Our  blood  is  mostly  made  up  of  four  components:  plasma,  red  blood  cells,  white  blood  cells,  and
colorless  blood  cells  called  platelets.  An  instrument  called  a  hematocrit  (because  it  “judges”  the
blood) is used to separate a sample of blood into its components. The normal hematocrit for men is
about 48%, for women about 38%. An abnormal proportion of red blood cells, either too many or too
few, is a good early indicator of many diseases. So when you give blood as part of a physical exam,
your hematocrit is one of the findings your doctor will often check.

- JUR comes from the Latin verb jurare, “to swear, take an oath,” and the noun jus, “right or law.” A
