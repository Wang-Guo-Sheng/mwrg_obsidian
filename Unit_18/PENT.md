PENT comes from the Greek word for “five.” The Pentagon in Washington, D.C., the world's largest
office building, has five sides just like any other pentagon. And a pentatonic scale in music has only
five notes, rather than the seven notes of the major or minor scale.

•  The  modern  Olympic  pentathlon  includes  swimming,  cross-country  running,  horseback  riding,
fencing, and target shooting. 

The Greek word athlos means “contest or trial,” so to be an athlete you had to compete in physical
contests.  The  ancient  Greek  pentathlon  tested  warriors'  skills  in  sprinting,  long  jumping,  javelin
throwing, discus throwing, and wrestling, none of which are part of today's Olympic pentathlon. But a
pentathlete must still have muscles and reflexes suited to almost any kind of physical feat. See also
decathlon.

• The Pentateuch takes us from the creation of the world up to the Israelites' arrival in the Promised
Land. 

Pentateuch  means  simply  “five  books.”  In  Greek,  the  Pentateuch  (which  Jews  call  the  Torah)
includes the books of Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy. These contain some of
the  oldest  and  most  famous  stories  in  the  Bible,  including  those  of  Adam  and  Eve,  Jacob  and  his
brothers,  and  Moses,  as  well  as  some  of  the  oldest  codes  of  law  known,  including  the  Ten
Commandments.

- [[pentameter]] 

 A line of poetry consisting of five metrical feet. 

• Shakespeare's tragedies are written mainly in blank verse, which is unrhymed iambic pentameter. 

In a line of poetry written in perfect iambic pentameter, there are five unstressed syllables, each of
which  is  followed  by  a  stressed  syllable.  Each  pair  of  syllables  is  a  metrical  foot  called  an  iamb.
Much of the greatest poetry in English has been written in iambic pentameter; Chaucer, Shakespeare,
and Milton used it more than any other meter. Robert Frost's line “I'm going out to clean the pasture
spring”  is  an  example  of  it;  his  “And  miles  to  go  before  I  sleep”  is  instead  an  example  of  iambic
tetrameter, with only four accented syllables.

clothes more revealing than floor-length skirts and long pants. 

In ancient Greek, pentekoste meant “fiftieth day”—that is, the fiftieth day after Easter (counting Easter
itself). On that day, Christians celebrate an event described in the Bible that took place fifty days after
Christ's  resurrection,  when  the  apostles  heard  the  rush  of  a  mighty  wind,  saw  tongues  of  fire
descending on them, and heard the Holy Spirit speaking from their own mouths but in other tongues
(languages). “Speaking in tongues,” when everyone in a congregation may begin talking in languages
that no one can understand, is the best-known practice of Pentecostals. Pentecostals belong to many
different denominations; with growing numbers especially in Latin America and Africa, there may be
over 500 million Pentecostals worldwide.
