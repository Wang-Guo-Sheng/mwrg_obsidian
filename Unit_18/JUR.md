- JUR comes from the Latin verb jurare, “to swear, take an oath,” and the noun jus, “right or law.” A
jury,  made  up  of  jurors,  makes  judgments  based  on  the  law.  And  a  personal  injury  was  originally
something done to you that a court would find unjust.

- [[jurisprudence]] 

 (1) A system of law. (2) The study and philosophy of law. 

• As a young lawyer his heroes were the crusaders of 20th-century jurisprudence, especially Louis
Brandeis and Thurgood Marshall. 

Jurisprudence  as  a  study  may  have  begun  in  the  Roman  empire,  where  schools  of  law  were  first
established. And Roman jurisprudence, like so many other things the Romans created, served as the
model  in  later  centuries  throughout  the  Western  world.  And  like  many  other  legal  words,
jurisprudence is used only in formal writing.

- [[abjure]] 

 To reject formally. 

•  The  Spanish  Inquisition  forced  many  Jews  to  abjure  their  religion  and  adopt  Christianity  or  be
burned at the stake. 

From  its  Latin  roots,  abjure  would  mean  literally  “to  swear  away.”  Thus,  after  the  holidays  many
people abjure all sweets and fattening foods, often making their vow in front of friends or relatives.
Abjure is often confused with adjure, which means “to command solemnly, as if under oath.” Thus, a
judge might adjure a criminal to change his ways; but it's up to the criminal to abjure a life of crime.

- [[perjury]] 

 The crime of telling a lie under oath. 

• Found guilty of perjury for lying under oath in front of a Congressional committee, he was sentenced
to two years in prison. 

The prefix per- [[in]] Latin often meant “harmfully.” So witnesses who perjure themselves do harm to the
truth by knowingly telling a lie. Not all lying is perjury, only lying under oath; so perjury generally
takes  place  either  in  court  or  before  a  legislative  body  such  as  Congress.  To  avoid  committing
perjury, a witness or defendant may “take the Fifth”: that is, refuse to answer a question because the
answer might be an admission of guilt, and the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution forbids forcing a
citizen to admit to being guilty of a crime.

- [[de]] jure 

 Based on or according to the law. 

• The country is a de jure democracy, but since one party controls all the media outlets it really isn't
one. 

Coming straight from Latin, de jure is a term used mostly, but not always, in legal writing. Sometimes
it's not enough to have something written into law; if a law isn't enforced, it might as well not exist.
And if ordinary citizens are too scared of what would happen to them if they exercised their rights,
then  they  don't  really  have  those  rights  at  all.  Unfortunately,  many  countries  have  constitutions  and
laws that sound good but turn out not to have much effect. So de jure is almost always used in contrast
to something else; its opposite is de facto (see de facto).
