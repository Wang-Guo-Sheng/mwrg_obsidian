- MICRO, from the Greek mikros, meaning “small,” is a popular English prefix. A microscope lets the
eye see microscopic objects, and libraries store the pages of old newspapers on microfilm at 1/400th
of their original size. And we continue to attach micro- [[to]] lots of familiar words; most of us could
figure out the meaning of microbus and microquake without ever having heard them before. Scientists
often  use  micro-  to  mean  “millionth”;  thus,  a  microsecond  is  a  millionth  of  a  second,  and  a
micrometer is a millionth of a meter.

- [[microbe]] 
size. 

  An  organism  (such  as  a  bacterium)  of  microscopic  or  less  than  microscopic

• Vaccines reduce the risk of diseases by using dead or greatly weakened microbes to stimulate the
immune system. 

A hint of the Greek word bios, meaning “life,” can be seen in microbe. Microbes, or microorganisms,
include bacteria, protozoa, fungi, algae, amoebas, and slime molds. Many people think of microbes as
simply the causes of disease, but every human is actually the host to billions of microbes, and most of
them are essential to our life. Much research is now going into possible microbial sources of future
energy; algae looks particularly promising, as do certain newly discovered or created microbes that
can produce cellulose, to be turned into ethanol and other biofuels.

- [[microbiologist]] 
bacteria and viruses. 

 A scientist who studies extremely small forms of life, such as

• Food microbiologists study the tiny organisms that cause spoiling and foodborne illness. 

Since  microorganisms  are  involved  in  almost  every  aspect  of  life  on  earth,  microbiologists  work
across  a  broad  range  of  subject  areas.  Some  study  only  viruses,  some  only  bacteria.  A  marine
microbiologist  studies  the  roles  of  microbial  communities  in  the  sea.  A  soil  microbiologist  might
focus on the use and spread of nitrogen. Veterinary microbiologists might research bacteria that attack
racehorses or diagnose anthrax in cows. And the government puts microbiologists to work studying
whether microbes could adapt to life on the surface of Mars, and how to defend ourselves against the
possibility of germ warfare.

- [[microbrew]] 

 A beer made by a brewery that makes beer in small amounts. 

• As a city of 75,000 people with eight breweries, it offers a greater variety of microbrews per capita
than any other place in America. 

Microbrews  are  usually  beers  or  ales  made  with  special  malts  and  hops,  unfiltered  and
unpasteurized,  and  thus  distinctive  in  their  aroma  and  flavor.  Many  microbreweries  double  as
bar/restaurants, called brewpubs,  where  the  gleaming  vats  may  be  visible  behind  a  glass  partition.
“Craft brewing” and the opening of local brewpubs began in earnest in the U.S. in the 1980s. But not
everyone is willing to pay extra for a beer, and lots of people are simply used to the blander taste of
the best-selling beers, so by 2008 microbrews still only accounted for about 4% of all beer sold in
the U.S.

- [[microclimate]] 

 The essentially uniform local climate of a small site or habitat. 

• Temperature, light, wind speed, and moisture are the essential components of a microclimate. 

The  microclimate  of  an  industrial  park  may  be  quite  different  from  that  of  a  nearby  wooded  park,
since the plants absorb light and heat while asphalt parking lots and rooftops radiate them back into
the air. A microclimate can offer a small growing area for crops that wouldn't do well in the wider
region,  so  skilled  gardeners  take  advantage  of  microclimates  by  carefully  choosing  and  positioning
their  plants.  San  Francisco's  hills,  oceanfront,  and  bay  shore,  along  with  its  alternating  areas  of
concrete and greenery, make it a city of microclimates.

- MULTI comes from the Latin word multus, meaning “many.” Thus, a multicultural society is one that
