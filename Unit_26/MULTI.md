- MULTI comes from the Latin word multus, meaning “many.” Thus, a multicultural society is one that
includes people of several different countries, languages, and religions; a multimedia artwork uses
two  or  more  artistic  media  (dance,  music,  film,  spoken  text,  etc.);  and  a  multitude  of  complaints
reaching your office would be a great many indeed.

- [[multicellular]] 

 Consisting of many cells. 

• Multicellular organisms—fungi, plants, and animals—have specialized cells that perform different
functions. 

Multicellular organisms are distinguished from the very primitive single-celled organisms—bacteria,
algae, amoebas, etc. Even sponges, simple as they are, have specialized cell types such as digestive
cells.  In  complex  multicellular  organisms,  only  the  surface  cells  can  exchange  substances  with  the
external  environment,  so  the  organisms  have  developed  transport  systems  such  as  the  circulatory
system, in which the blood brings gases and nutrients to the cells and removes waste products from
them.

- [[multidisciplinary]] 

 Involving two or more subject areas. 

• Her favorite class was Opera, a multidisciplinary class taught jointly by a music professor and a
literature professor. 

A discipline is a field of study. So a multidisciplinary (or interdisciplinary) course is a team-taught
course  in  which  students  are  asked  to  understand  a  single  subject  as  it's  seen  by  two  or  more
traditional  disciplines.  Multidisciplinary  teaching  can  open  students'  eyes  to  different  views  of  a
subject  that  they  had  never  considered  before.  A  multidisciplinary  panel  discussion,  on  the  other
hand, presents views from scholars in different fields but may leave any merging of the information to
the audience.

- [[multifarious]] 

 Having or occurring in great variety; diverse. 

• Natives put the coconut palm to multifarious uses: using the nuts for eating, the juice for drinking, the
wood for building huts, the leaves for thatch, the fiber for mats, and the shells for utensils. 

Multifarious is a rather grand word, probably not for everyday use, but when you want to emphasize
great variety—such as the huge number of uses to which a state-of-the-art cell phone can be put—it
can be effective. Dictionary fans are constantly amazed by the multifarious meanings of the word set
(47  of  them  in  one  unabridged  dictionary),  and  thesaurus  lovers  may  marvel  at  the  multifarious
synonyms for drunk.

- [[multilateral]] 

 Involving more than two nations or parties. 

•  A  couple  of  times  a  year,  representatives  of  the  large  industrial  democracies  meet  for  a  round  of
multilateral trade negotiations. 

Since  lateral  means  “side”  (see  LATER),  multilateral  means  basically  “many-sided.”  The
philosophy  of  multilateralism  claims  that  the  best  solutions  generally  result  when  as  many  of  the
world's nations as possible are involved in discussions, and multilateralists often favor strengthening
the  United  Nations.  Today  multilateralism  can  be  seen  at  work  in,  for  example,  the  World  Health
Organization, the World Trade Organization, and the International Criminal Court. But the U.S. doesn't
always join the major multilateral organizations, instead often behaving as if a unilateral approach—
that is, going it alone—was best for the interests of a powerful nation.
