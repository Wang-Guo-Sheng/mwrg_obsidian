HEM/HEMO comes from the Greek word for “blood” and is found at the beginning of many medical
terms. By dropping the h-, the same word produced the suffix -emia, which likewise shows up in lots
of “blood” words, including anemia, leukemia and hyperglycemia.

- [[hemorrhage]] 
loss or outflow. 

 (1) A large loss of blood from a blood vessel. (2) A rapid and uncontrollable

•  He  arrived  at  the  emergency  room  reporting  headache,  nausea,  and  drowsiness,  and  the  doctor
immediately suspected that he'd suffered a brain hemorrhage. 

A hemorrhage usually results from either a severe blow to the body or from medication being taken
for something else. Though many hemorrhages aren't particularly serious, those that occur in the brain
(cerebral  hemorrhages)  can  be  life-threatening.  In  older  people,  hemorrhages  are  often  caused  by
blood-thinning  medication  taken  to  prevent  heart  attacks.  A  bruise  (or  hematoma)  is  a  hemorrhage
close enough to the surface of the skin to be visible. Hemorrhage is also a verb, which isn't always
used to talk about actual blood; thus, we may hear that a business is hemorrhaging money, or that the
U.S. has been hemorrhaging industrial jobs for decades. Be careful when writing hemorrhage; it's not
an easy word to spell.

- [[hematology]] 

 The study of blood and blood-forming organs. 

• Her specialty in hematology let her work with patients of all ages and types, since blood problems
may affect almost anyone. 

Blood  is  basic  to  almost  all  the  body's  functions,  and  a  blood  test  can  reveal  more  about  your
physical condition than almost any other kind of examination, so hematology is an important medical
specialty, with many separate subjects. Since blood cells are formed in the bone marrow, the bones
are  one  important  focus  for  hematologists.  The  coagulation,  or  thickening,  of  the  blood  is  another
important subject, since coagulation is what keeps us from bleeding to death from even small wounds.
And  there  are  dozens  of  serious  blood  diseases,  including  anemia  (a  lack  of  red  blood  cells)  and
leukemia (cancer involving a buildup of white blood cells).

- [[hemophilia]] 

 A bleeding disorder caused by the blood's inability to coagulate. 

•  When  he  was  a  child,  his  hemophilia  had  kept  him  from  joining  the  other  kids  in  rough  play  at
recess. 

The  dreaded  disease  known  as  hemophilia  is  the  result  of  an  inherited  gene,  and  almost  always
strikes boys rather than girls (though mothers may pass the gene to their sons). Since the blood lacks
an ingredient that causes it to clot or coagulate when a blood vessel breaks, even a minor wound can
cause a hemophiliac to bleed to death if not treated. Bleeding can be particularly dangerous when it's
entirely  internal,  with  no  visible  wound,  since  the  person  may  not  be  aware  it's  happening.  Queen
Victoria  transmitted  the  hemophilia  gene  to  royal  families  all  across  Europe;  the  hemophilia  of  a
young  Russian  prince  played  a  part  in  the  downfall  of  the  Russian  czars.  Today,  hemophiliacs  take
drugs that stop the bleeding by speeding coagulation, and hemophiliac life expectancies in developed
countries are almost as long as the average.

- [[hemoglobin]] 
body's tissues and transports carbon dioxide from the tissues back to the lungs. 

  The  element  in  blood  that  transports  oxygen  from  the  lungs  to  the

• Her doctor had noticed her low hemoglobin count and was insisting that she include more iron-rich
vegetables in her diet. 

When filled with oxygen, the hemoglobin in your blood is bright red; returning to the lungs without its
oxygen, it loses its brightness and becomes somewhat bluish. Hemoglobin levels can change from day
to day, and may be affected by such factors as a lack of iron in the diet, a recent loss of blood, and
being pregnant. When you give blood, a nurse first pricks your finger to test your hemoglobin level; a
low hemoglobin count indicates anemia and may mean that you shouldn't give blood that day. Mild
anemia is generally of little importance, but some types can be very serious.
