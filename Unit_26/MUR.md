MUR, from the Latin noun murus, meaning “wall,” has produced a modest number of English words.

- [[muralist]] 

 A painter of wall paintings. 

• She's enjoying her new career as a muralist, but it's terribly hard on her when she sees her works
wrecked by vandals. 

Any  wall  painting  may  be  called  a  mural.  Murals  have  been  around  since  long  before  the  framed
painting.  Scenic  murals  date  back  to  at  least  2000  B.C.  on  the  island  of  Crete.  Indoor  murals  for
private  homes  were  popular  in  ancient  Greece  and  Rome,  and  many  of  those  at  Pompeii  were
preserved by the lava of Mt. Vesuvius. In the Renaissance the muralists Raphael and Michelangelo
created great wall and ceiling paintings for the Catholic Church, and Leonardo da Vinci's The Last
Supper became one of the most famous of all murals. Mural painting saw a great revival in Mexico
beginning  in  the  1920s,  when  a  group  of  muralists  inspired  by  the  Mexican  Revolution,  including
Diego  Rivera,  J.  C.  Orozco,  and  D.  A.  Siqueiros,  began  taking  their  intensely  political  art  to  the
public by creating giant wall paintings, sometimes on outdoor surfaces.

- [[intramural]] 
school. 

 Existing or occurring within the bounds of an institution, especially a

• At college he lacked the time to go out for sports in a serious way, but he did play intramural hockey
all four years. 

With its Latin prefix intra-, “within” (not to be confused with inter-, “between”), intramural means
literally “within the walls.” The word is usually used for sports played between teams made up only
from students at one campus. Intramural athletics is often the most popular extracurricular activity at a
college or university.

- [[extramural]] 
unit such as a school or hospital. 

 Existing outside or beyond the walls or boundaries of an organized

• “Hospital Without Walls” is an extramural program that offers home health-care services. 

Extramural  contains  the  Latin  extra-,  meaning  “outside”  or  “beyond”  (see  EXTRA).  The  walls  in
extramural  are  usually  those  of  schools,  colleges,  and  universities,  and  the  word  is  often  seen  in
phrases like “extramural activities” and “extramural competition,” referring to things that involve the
world  beyond  the  campus.  Some  institutions  use  the  term  “extramural  study”  for  what  others  call
“distance learning”—that is, teaching and learning by means of Web connections to the classroom and
to  videos  of  lectures.  Money  that  flows  into  universities  to  support  research  (from  foundations,
government institutes, etc.) is usually called “extramural income.”

- [[immure]] 

 To enclose within, or as if within, walls; imprison. 

•  In  Dumas's  famous  novel,  the  Count  of  Monte  Cristo  is  in  fact  a  sailor  who  had  been  unjustly
immured in an island prison for 15 years before breaking out and taking his revenge. 

In Eastern European legend, whenever a large bridge or fort was completed, a young maiden would
be immured in the stonework as a sacrifice. (It's not certain that such things were actually done.) In
Poe's grim story “A Cask of Amontillado,” a man achieves revenge on a fellow nobleman by chaining
him to a cellar wall and bricking him up alive. At the end of Verdi's great opera Aida, Aida joins her
lover  so  that  they  can  die  immured  together.  But  real-life  examples  of  immurement  as  a  final
punishment are somewhat harder to find.

- POLIS/POLIT comes from the Greek word for “city.” The ancient Greek city-states, such as Athens,
