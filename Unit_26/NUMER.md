- NUMER  comes  from  the  Latin  words  meaning  “number”  and  “to  count.”  A  numeral  is  the  symbol
that represents a number. Numerous means “many,” and innumerable means “countless.” Numerical
superiority is superiority in numbers, and your numerical standing in a class is a ranking expressed as
a number.

- [[numerology]] 

 The study of the occult significance of numbers. 

• Though he didn't believe in numerology as a mystical bond between numbers and living things, he
never went out on Friday the 13th. 

As an element of astrology and fortune-telling, numerology has long been employed to predict future
events. For many early Christians, 3 represented the Trinity, 6 represented earthly perfection, and 7
represented heavenly perfection; and still today, many of us like to group things into sets of 3 or 7, for
no  particular  reason.  Numerology  has  also  been  used  to  interpret  personality;  in  particular,
numerologists  may  assign  numbers  to  each  letter  of  a  person's  name  and  use  the  resulting  figures,
along with the person's date of birth, as a guide to his or her character.

- [[alphanumeric]] 

 Having or using both letters and numbers. 

•  Back  in  the  1950s,  we  always  spoke  our  phone  numbers  in  alphanumeric  form,  using  the  letters
printed on the dial: for example, “TErrace 5-6642,” instead of “835-6642.” 

Alphanumeric  passwords  are  much  harder  for  a  hacker  to  crack  than  plain  alphabetic  passwords,
since  the  number  of  possible  combinations  is  so  much  greater.  License  plates  usually  contain  both
letters and numbers, since, for a big state or country, the plate wouldn't be large enough to fit enough
numbers  for  everyone.  In  computing,  the  standard  alphanumeric  codes,  such  as  ASCII,  may  contain
not only ordinary letters and numerals but also punctuation marks and math symbols.

- [[enumerate]] 

 To specify one after another; list. 

• The thing he hated most was when she would start enumerating his faults out loud, while he would
sit scowling into the newspaper trying to ignore her. 

In a census year, the U.S. government attempts to enumerate every single citizen of the country—a task
that,  even  in  the  modern  era  of  technology,  isn't  truly  possible.  Medical  tests  often  require  the
enumeration  of  bacteria,  viruses,  or  other  organisms  to  determine  the  progress  of  a  disease  or  the
effectiveness  of  a  medication.  Despite  its  numer-  root,  you  don't  have  to  use  numbers  when
enumerating.  For  students  of  government  and  law,  the  “enumerated  powers”  are  the  specific
responsibilities  of  the  Congress,  as  listed  in  the  U.S.  Constitution;  these  are  the  only  powers  that
Congress has, a fact that the Tenth Amendment makes even more clearly.

- [[supernumerary]] 

 Exceeding the usual number. 

•  Whenever  the  workload  for  the  city's  courts  and  judges  gets  too  large,  supernumerary  judges  are
called in to help. 

Supernumerary starts off with the Latin prefix super-, “above” (see SUPER). You may have heard of
someone  being  born  with  supernumerary  teeth,  supernumerary  fingers,  or  supernumerary  toes.  A
supernumerary rainbow may show up as a faint line—red, green, or purple—just touching the main
colored arc. Supernumerary is also a noun: A supernumerary is usually someone in a crowd scene
onstage, otherwise known as an “extra” or a “spear-carrier.”
