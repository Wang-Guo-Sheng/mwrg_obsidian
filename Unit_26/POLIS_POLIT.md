- POLIS/POLIT comes from the Greek word for “city.” The ancient Greek city-states, such as Athens,
Thebes, and Sparta, operated much like separate nations, so all their politics was local, like all their
public policy—and even all their police!

- [[politic]] 

 (1) Cleverly tactful. (2) Wise in promoting a plan or plan of action. 

•  Anger  is  rarely  a  politic  way  to  seek  agreement,  since  it  usually  comes  across  as  rude  and  self-
righteous. 

Politic behavior in class always requires a respectful attitude toward your teacher. It's never politic
to  ask  for  a  raise  when  your  boss  is  in  a  terrible  mood.  And  once  teenagers  learn  to  drive,  they
quickly learn the politic way to ask for the car—that is, whatever gets the keys without upsetting the
parents. As you can see, politic can be used for many situations that have nothing to do with public
politics.

- [[politicize]] 

 To give a political tone or character to. 

• By 1968 the Vietnam War had deeply politicized most of America's college campuses. 

Sexual harassment was once seen as a private matter, but in the 1980s and '90s it became thoroughly
politicized,  with  women  loudly  pressuring  lawmakers  to  make  it  illegal.  So,  at  the  same  time,  the
issue of sexual harassment politicized many women, who began to take an interest in political action
because of it. In other words, we may speak of an issue becoming politicized, but also of a person or
group becoming politicized.

- [[acropolis]] 

 The high, fortified part of a city, especially an ancient Greek city. 

• On the Athenian Acropolis, high above the rest of the city, stands the Parthenon, a temple to Athena. 

The Greek root acro- [[means]] “high”; thus, an acropolis is basically a “high city.” Ancient cities often
grew  up  around  a  high  point,  in  order  that  they  could  easily  be  defended.  The  Greeks  and  Romans
usually  included  in  their  acropolises  temples  to  the  city's  most  important  gods;  so,  for  example,
Athens built a great temple on its Acropolis to its protector goddess, Athena, from which the city took
its  name.  Many  later  European  cities  cluster  around  a  walled  castle  on  a  height,  into  which  the
population  of  the  city  and  the  surrounding  area  could  retreat  in  case  of  attack,  and  even  South
American cities often contain a similar walled area on high ground.

- [[megalopolis]] 
one or more cities with the surrounding suburbs. 

  (1)  A  very  large  city.  (2)  A  thickly  populated  area  that  includes

•  With  its  rapid  development,  the  southern  coast  of  Florida  around  Miami  quickly  became  a
megalopolis. 

A  “large  city”  named  Megalopolis  was  founded  in  Greece  in  371  B.C.  to  help  defend  the  region
called  Arcadia  against  the  city-state  of  Sparta.  Though  a  stadium  seating  20,000  was  built  there,
indicating  the  city's  impressive  size  for  its  time,  Megalopolis  today  has  only  about  5,000  people.
Social scientists now identify 10 megalopolises in the U.S., each with more than 10 million people.
The one on the eastern seaboard that stretches from Boston to Washington, D.C., where the densely
populated  cities  seem  to  flow  into  each  other  all  along  the  coast,  is  now  home  to  over  50  million
people. But it's easily surpassed by the Japanese megalopolis that includes Tokyo, with more than 80
million inhabitants.
