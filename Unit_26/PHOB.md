- PHOB  comes  from  the  Greek  noun  phobos,  “fear,”  and  it  shows  up  clearly  in  our  noun  phobia,
meaning “unusual fear of a specific thing.” Phobias vary greatly in seriousness and also in frequency.
Most  of  us  have  experienced  claustrophobia  at  some  time,  but  few  truly  suffer  from  fear  of  the
number 13, a condition known as triskaidekaphobia.

- [[acrophobic]] 

 Fearful of heights. 

• She's so acrophobic that, whenever she can't avoid taking the route that includes the high bridge, she
asks the police to drive her across. 

The  Greek  akron  means  “height”  or  “summit,”  and  the  acro-  root  can  be  seen  in  such  words  as
acrobat  and  Acropolis.  Almost  everyone  has  some  fear  of  heights,  but  an  abnormal  dread  of  high
places, along with the vertigo (dizziness) that most acrophobes also experience, are common as well;
in  fact,  acrophobia  is  one  of  the  half-dozen  most  common  recognized  phobias.  Acrophobia  and
claustrophobia both play a role in another well-known phobia: the fear of flying, itself often known as
aerophobia.

- [[agoraphobia]] 
especially in open or public places. 

  A  fear  of  being  in  embarrassing  or  inescapable  situations,

•  After  barely  surviving  a  terrible  attack  of  agoraphobia  in  the  middle  of  the  Sonoran  Desert,  he
finally agree to start seeing a psychologist. 

The agora  was  the  marketplace  in  ancient  Greece;  thus,  agoraphobia  often  involves  fear  of  public
places  and  crowds.  But  it  also  may  involve  fear  of  being  in  shops,  or  even  fear  of  being  in  open
spaces,  or  fear  of  traveling  alone.  It  may  also  be  a  fear  of  experiencing  some  uncontrollable  or
embarrassing event (like fainting) in the presence of others with no help available. Agoraphobia can
be  hard  to  understand  for  those  who  don't  suffer  from  it,  especially  because  it  can  take  so  many
different forms, but it is often a serious and socially crippling condition.

- [[xenophobe]] 

 One who has a fear or hatred of strangers or foreigners. 

• A Middle Easterner reading the U.S.'s visa restrictions might feel that the State Department was run
by xenophobes. 

Xenophobe  is  partly  based  on  the  Greek  noun  xenos,  meaning  “stranger,  guest,  foreigner.”  Unlike
other  phobias,  xenophobia  isn't  really  considered  an  abnormal  condition;  instead,  it's  generally
thought  of  as  just  serious  narrow-mindedness,  the  kind  of  thinking  that  goes  along  with  racism  and
extreme patriotism. In times of war, a government will often actually try to turn all its citizens into
xenophobes.

- [[arachnophobia]] 

 Having a fear or dislike of spiders. 

• At 50, my sister still suffers from arachnophobia, and can't sleep in a room unless she knows it has
no spiders. 

In  Greek  mythology,  Arachne  was  a  weaver  of  such  skill  that  she  dared  to  challenge  the  goddess
Athena at her craft. When she won their competition by weaving a tapestry disrespectful to the gods,
the  enraged  Athena  tore  it  to  shreds,  and  in  despair  Arachne  hanged  herself.  Out  of  pity,  Athena
loosened the rope, which became a cobweb, and changed Arachne into a spider. Today, the spiders,
scorpions,  mites,  and  ticks  all  belong  to  the  class  known  as  arachnids.  Arachnophobia  is  the  most
common  of  the  animal  phobias;  but  many  people  suffer  from  similar  phobias  regarding  snakes
(ophidiophobia), dogs (cynophobia), and mice and rats (musophobia).
