- PAR, from the Latin, means “equal.” Our English word par means an amount taken as an average or a
standard, and especially the standard score for each hole on a golf course—which is why the phrase
“par for the course” means “about as well as expected.” We compare things to see if they're equal;
similar  things  can  be  called  comparable—that  is,  “equal  with.”  And  “on  a  par  with”  means
“comparable to.”

- [[parity]] 

 The state of being equal. 

• That year the Canadian dollar reached parity with the U.S. dollar for the first time in three decades. 

Parity has special meanings in such fields as physics, math, medicine, genetics, and marketing. Back
when  the  Soviet  Union  and  the  U.S.  were  opposing  superpowers,  there  was  often  talk  of  parity  in
nuclear  weapons  between  the  two  sides.  We  sometimes  hear  about  parity  between  mental  and
physical health in insurance coverage, or parity in colleges' funding of men's and women's athletics.
But  parity  may  be  most  common  in  discussions  of  currencies.  The  exchange  rate  between  two
national  currencies  often  changes  every  day,  as  each  drifts  higher  or  lower,  and  occasionally  two
similar currencies, such as the euro and the U.S. dollar, will achieve parity, but it rarely lasts long.

- [[disparity]] 

 A noticeable and often unfair difference between people or things. 

• He'd been noticing an increasing disparity between what the government was claiming and what he
saw happening all around him. 

Disparity  contains  the  Latin  dis,  meaning  “apart”  or  “non-”  (see  DIS),  so  a  disparity  is  a  kind  of
“nonequality.” The word is often used to describe a social or economic condition that's considered
unfairly  unequal:  a  racial  disparity  in  hiring,  a  health  disparity  between  the  rich  and  the  poor,  an
income disparity between men and women, and so on. Its adjective, disparate (accented on the first
syllable), is often used to emphasize strong differences.

- [[nonpareil]] 

 Someone or something of unequaled excellence. 

• Critics seem to agree that this is the new nonpareil of video-game consoles, the one to beat. 

American  children  learn  this  word  (even  if  they  can't  pronounce  it)  as  the  name  of  the  candies
covered  with  white  sugar  pellets  that  they  buy  at  the  movie  theater,  and  it's  also  the  name  of  the
pellets themselves. But the more general meaning is common too. Nonpareil is also an adjective. A
famous boxing champion of the 1920s was known as Nonpareil Jack Dempsey, when he wasn't being
called  “the  Manassa  Mauler.”  Like  its  synonyms  paragon  and  peerless, nonpareil  is  popular  as  a
company and product name; it's also the name of a fruit, an almond, a bird, and a butterfly.

- [[subpar]] 

 Below a usual or normal level. 

• Because of a severe cold, her performance that evening had been subpar, but the audience seemed to
love it anyway. 

Since  sub-  means  “below”  (see  SUB),  almost  anything  that  fails  to  measure  up  to  a  traditional
standard may be called subpar. So you may hear of subpar ratings for a TV show, subpar care at a
nursing home, subpar attendance at a concert, or subpar work by a contractor. If you played a subpar
round of golf, though, you needed more strokes than you should have.

- PHOB  comes  from  the  Greek  noun  phobos,  “fear,”  and  it  shows  up  clearly  in  our  noun  phobia,
