- KILO is the French version of the Greek word chilioi, meaning “thousand.” France is also where the
metric system originated, in the years following the French Revolution. So in English, kilo- [[shows]] up
chiefly  in  metric-system  units.  Before  the  computer  age,  the  most  familiar  kilo-  words  for  English-
speakers were probably kilowatt, meaning “1,000 watts,” and kilowatt-hour, meaning the amount of
energy equal to one kilowatt over the course of an hour.

- [[kilobyte]] 

 A unit of computer information equal to 1,024 bytes. 

• A 200-word paragraph in the simplest text format takes up about a kilobyte of storage space on your
hard drive. 

Knowing  the  root  kilo-,  you  might  think  a  kilobyte  would  be  exactly  1,000  bytes.  But  actually  a
kilobyte represents the power of 2 that comes closest to 1,000: that is, 210 (2 to the 10th power), or 2
×  2  ×  2  ×  2  ×  2  ×  2  ×  2  ×  2  ×  2  ×  2,  or  1,024.  Why  2?  Because  the  capacity  of  memory  chips  is
always  based  on  powers  of  2.  Locations  in  electronic  memory  circuits  are  identified  by  binary
numbers (numbers that use only the digits 0 and 1), so the number of addressable locations becomes a
power of 2.

- [[kilometer]] 

 A unit of length equal to 1,000 meters. 

•  U.S.  highway  signs  near  the  Canadian  border  often  show  distances  in  kilometers  in  addition  to
miles. 

A kilometer is equal to about 62/100 of a mile, and a mile is equal to about 1.61 kilometers. The U.S.
has  been  slow  to  adopt  metric  measures,  which  are  used  almost  everywhere  else  in  the  world.
Though  our  car  speedometers  are  often  marked  in  both  miles  and  kilometers,  the  U.S.  and  Great
Britain are practically the only developed nations that still show miles rather than kilometers on their
road  signs.  But  even  in  the  U.S.,  footraces  are  usually  measured  in  meters  or  kilometers,  like  the
Olympic races. Runners normally abbreviate kilometer to K: “a 5K race” (3.1 miles), “the 10K run”
(6.2 miles), and so on.

- [[kilohertz]] 

 A unit of frequency equal to 1,000 cycles per second. 

• A drone aircraft nosedived and crashed after an onboard tape recorder turned out to be using a 10-
kilohertz signal, the same frequency used by the aircraft's control system. 

If  your  favorite  AM  radio  station  has  a  frequency  of  680  kilohertz  (kHz),  that  means  the  station's
transmitter  is  oscillating  (vibrating)  at  a  rate  of  680,000  cycles  per  second  (i.e.,  680,000  times  a
second). A related term is megahertz (MHz), meaning “millions of cycles per second.” Shortwave
radio  operates  between  5.9  and  26.1  MHz,  and  the  FM  radio  band  operates  between  88  and  108
MHz. Garage-door openers work at about 40 MHz, baby monitors work at 49 MHz, and so on. The
terms  hertz,  kilohertz  and  megahertz  honor  the  great  German  physicist  Heinrich  Hertz,  the  first
person to broadcast and receive radio waves.

- [[kilogram]] 

 A unit of weight equal to 1,000 grams. 

• The kilogram is the only base unit of measurement still defined by a physical object rather than a
physical constant (such as the speed of light). 

The original concept of the kilogram, as the mass of a cubic decimeter of water (a bit more than a
quart), was adopted as the base unit of mass by the new revolutionary government of France in 1793.
In 1875, in the Treaty of the Meter, 17 countries, including the U.S., adopted the French kilogram as
an international standard. In 1889 a new international standard for the kilogram, a metal bar made of
platinum  iridium,  was  agreed  to;  President  Benjamin  Harrison  officially  received  the  1-kilogram
cylinder  for  the  U.S.  in  1890.  But  no  one  uses  that  bar  very  often;  for  all  practical  purposes,  a
kilogram equals 2.2 pounds.
