- ITIS,  a  suffix  found  in  both  Greek  and  Latin,  means  “disease”  or  “inflammation.”  In  appendicitis
your  appendix  is  swollen  and  painful,  and  in  tonsillitis  the  same  is  true  of  your  tonsils.  With
laryngitis,  your  throat  and  larynx  may  become  so  sore  that  it's  difficult  to  talk.  Some  of  us  enjoy
making up our own -itis words; high-school teachers, for example, long ago noticed that many of their
seniors tended to lose all interest in schoolwork and start skipping classes, and labeled the condition
senioritis.

- [[bursitis]] 

 Inflammation of a lubricating sac (bursa), especially of the shoulder or elbow. 

• My barber developed bursitis after many years of lifting his arms all day. 

A  bursa  is  a  little  pouch  filled  with  fluid  that  sits  between  a  tendon  and  a  bone.  When  the  fluid
becomes  infected  by  bacteria  or  irritated  by  too  much  movement,  bursitis  results.  Throwing  a
baseball  too  many  times  at  one  session,  for  example,  may  inflame  and  irritate  one  of  the  bursae
(notice  the  plural  form)  in  the  shoulder.  Bursitis  in  another  part  of  the  body  may  be  known  by  a
traditional name such as “housemaid's knee,” “soldier's heel,” or “tennis elbow.” Bursitis generally
goes away after a few weeks of resting the affected area, and the pain can be treated with ice packs
and aspirin.

- [[hepatitis]] 

 Inflammation of the liver. 

•  His  skin  now  had  a  yellowish  tinge,  as  did  the  whites  of  his  eyes,  and  his  doctor  immediately
recognized the signs of advanced hepatitis. 

The  liver,  the  body's  largest  gland,  performs  many  important  tasks,  but  is  also  vulnerable  to  many
illnesses.  At  least  five  types  of  hepatitis,  labeled  with  the  letters  A–E,  are  caused  by  viruses.  The
most  common  are  hepatitis  A,  acquired  through  contaminated  food  and  water;  hepatitis  B,  which
usually travels via sexual activity or shared needles; and hepatitis C, generally passed through shared
needles. Some other types, including alcoholic hepatitis (caused by drinking too much alcohol), aren't
infectious.  There  are  vaccines  for  types  A  and  B,  and  drug  treatments  for  A,  B,  and  C,  though  the
drugs aren't always effective.

- [[bronchitis]] 

 Inflammation of the bronchial tubes. 

•  Before  the  smoking  ban  went  into  effect,  three  flight  attendants  had  sued  the  airline,  claiming
secondhand smoke was to blame for their bronchitis. 

The bronchial tubes carry air into the tiny branches and smaller cells of the lungs. In bronchitis, the
tubes become sore and you develop a deep cough. Bronchitis caused by bacteria can be treated with
antibiotics,  but  there's  no  drug  treatment  for  the  more  common  kind  caused  by  a  virus.  A  bout  of
bronchitis  may  involve  a  couple  of  weeks  of  coughing  (with  no  laughing  allowed),  weakness,  and
loss of energy and interest in doing things. Apart from that, bronchitis is rarely serious—at least if it
doesn't progress to pneumonia.

- [[tendinitis]] 
inflamed. 

  A  painful  condition  in  which  a  tendon  in  the  arm  or  leg  becomes

• After years of tennis and bicycling, she now has tendinitis of both the elbow and the knee. 

Tendinitis  is  often  seen  in  active,  healthy  people  who  do  something  that  requires  repeated  motion,
including golfers and tennis players (especially those with improper form), carpenters, and violinists.
It's  usually  treated  by  keeping  the  joint  from  moving,  by  means  of  a  splint,  cast,  or  bandage.  If  not
dealt with in time, tendinitis can turn into the more serious tendinosis, or tendon degeneration.
