- VERT  comes  from  the  Latin  verb  vertere,  meaning  “to  turn”  or  “to  turn  around.”  Vertigo  is  the
dizziness that makes it seem as if everything is turning around you. And an advertisement turns your
attention to a product or service.

- [[divert]] 
distracting from burdens or distress. 

  (1)  To  turn  from  one  purpose  or  course  to  another.  (2)  To  give  pleasure  to  by

•  The  farmers  had  successfully  diverted  some  of  the  river's  water  to  irrigate  their  crops  during  the
drought. 

The  Roman  circus  was  used  to  provide  diversion  for  its  citizens—and  sometimes  to  divert  their
attention from the government's failings as well. The diversion was often in the form of a fight—men
pitted  against  lions,  bears,  or  each  other—and  the  audience  was  sure  to  see  blood  and  death.  A
diverting  evening  these  days  might  instead  include  watching  the  same  kind  of  mayhem  on  a  movie
screen.

- [[converter]] 
or data) from one form to another. 

 A device that changes something (such as radio signals, radio frequencies,

• She was so indifferent to television that she hadn't even bought a converter, and her old TV sat there
useless until she finally lugged it down to the recycling center. 

Converters come in many forms. Travelers to foreign countries who bring along their electric razors
or hair dryers always pack a small electric converter, which can change direct current to alternating
current  or  vice  versa.  In  2009  millions  of  Americans  bought  digital-analog  converters,  small  box-
shaped devices that change the new broadcast digital signal to the analog signal that older TV sets
were  made  to  receive.  A  catalytic converter  is  the  pollution-control  device  attached  to  your  car's
exhaust system that converts pollutants such as carbon monoxide into harmless form.

- [[avert]] 

 (1) To turn (your eyes or gaze) away or aside. (2) To avoid or prevent. 

• General Camacho's announcement of lower food prices averted an immediate worker's revolt. 

Sensitive  people  avert  their  eyes  from  gory  accidents  and  scenes  of  disaster.  But  the  accident  or
disaster  might  itself  have  been  averted  if  someone  had  been  alert  enough.  Negotiators  may  avert  a
strike by all-night talks. In the Cuban missile crisis of 1962, it seemed that nuclear catastrophe was
barely averted. Aversion means “dislike or disgust”—that is, your feeling about something you can't
stand to look at.

- [[revert]] 
given back to (a former owner). 

  (1)  To  go  back  or  return  (to  an  earlier  state,  condition,  situation,  etc.).  (2)  To  be

•  Control  of  the  Panama  Canal  Zone,  first  acquired  by  the  U.S.  in  1903,  reverted  to  the  local
government in 1999. 

Since the prefix re- [[often]] means “back” (see RE-), the basic meaning of revert is “turn back.” Revert
and reversion often show up in legal documents, since property is often given to another person on the
condition  that  it  will  revert  to  the  original  owner  at  some  future  date  or  when  something  happens
(usually  the  death  of  the  second  person).  In  nonlegal  uses,  the  word  tends  to  show  up  in  negative
contexts. Many reformed drinkers, for example, eventually revert to their old ways, and most people
revert to smoking at least once or twice before succeeding in quitting for good.
