- BI/BIN  also  means  “two”  or  “double.”  A  bicycle  has  two  wheels,  and  binoculars  consist  of  two
little telescopes. Bigamy is marriage to two people at once. And a road built through the middle of a
neighborhood bisects it into two pieces.

- [[bipartisan]] 

 Involving members of two political parties. 

• The president named a bipartisan commission of three Republicans and three Democrats to look into
the issue. 

Partisan means basically “belonging to a party,” so something bipartisan combines two parties. Since
the United States today operates with a two-party system of government (even though the Constitution
says nothing about parties at all), legislation often must have some bipartisan support in order to pass
into  law.  Bipartisan  committees  review  legislation,  compromising  on  some  points  and  removing  or
adding others in order to make the bill more agreeable to both parties and make bipartisan support
from the entire legislature or Congress more likely.

- [[binary]] 
alternatives. 

 (1) Consisting of two things or parts; double. (2) Involving a choice between two

• The Milky Way contains numerous binary stars, each consisting of two stars orbiting each other. 

Binary has many uses, most of them in technical terms. Almost all computer software, for example, is
written in binary code,  which  uses  only  two  digits,  0  and  1,  0  standing  for  a  low-voltage  impulse
(“off”)  and  1  standing  for  a  high-voltage  impulse  (“on”).  All  information  is  kept  in  this  form.  The
word “HELLO,” for example, looks like this: 1001000 1000101 1001100 1001100 1001111.

- [[biennial]] 

 (1) Occurring every two years. (2) Continuing or lasting over two years. 

• The great biennial show of new art in Venice usually either puzzles or angers the critics. 

Biennial conventions, celebrations, competitions, and sports events come every two years. Biennials
are plants that live two years, bearing flowers and fruit only in the second year. (Carrots and sugar
beets are two examples; since we're only interested in their roots, we don't wait another year to see
their flower and fruit.) In contrast, semiannual means “twice a year.” But no one can agree whether
biweekly  means  “twice  a  week”  or  “every  two  weeks,”  and  whether  bimonthly  means  “twice  a
month” or “every two months.” Maybe we should stop using both of them until we can decide.

- [[bipolar]] 
attraction. 

  Having  two  opposed  forces  or  views;  having  two  poles  or  opposed  points  of

• Our bipolar Earth spins on an axis that extends between the North and South Poles. 

Magnets are always bipolar: one pole attracts and the other repels or drives away. And the Cold War
arms  race  was  bipolar,  since  it  mainly  involved  the  opposing  powers  of  the  U.S.  and  the  Soviet
Union.  But  the  word  is  encountered  most  often  today  in  bipolar disorder,  the  newer  name  of  what
used  to  be  called  manic-depressive  illness,  in  which  the  person  tends  to  swing  between  the  two
extremes, or poles, of high intensity and deep depression, with depression being the main condition.
Though an extremely serious illness, bipolar disorder can often be controlled by the drug lithium.
