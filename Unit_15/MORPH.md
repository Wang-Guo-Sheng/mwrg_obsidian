- MORPH comes from the Greek word for “shape.” Morph is itself an English word with a brand-new
meaning, which was needed when we began to digitally alter photographic images or shapes to make
them move or transform themselves in often astonishing ways.

- [[amorphous]] 

 Without a definite shape or form; shapeless. 

• Picking up an amorphous lump of clay, she molded it swiftly into a rough human shape. 

According to the Greek myths of the creation, the world began in an amorphous state; and the Bible
states that, at the beginning, “the earth was without form, and void.” Most of us have had nightmares
that consist mostly of just a looming amorphous but terrifying thing. A plan may have so little detail
that critics call it amorphous. And a new word may appear to name a previously amorphous group of
people, such as yuppie in 1983 and Generation X six years later.

- [[anthropomorphic]] 
(2) Seeing human traits in nonhuman things. 

 (1) Having or described as having human form or traits.

• The old, diseased tree had always been like a companion to her, though she didn't really approve of
such anthropomorphic feelings. 

Anthropomorphic means a couple of different things. In its first sense, an anthropomorphic cup is a
cup in the shape of a human, and anthropomorphic gods are human in appearance—like the Greek and
Roman  gods,  for  example,  even  though  Socrates  and  others  believed  that  their  fellow  Greeks  had
created the gods in their own image rather than the other way around. In its second sense, the animal
characters  in  Aesop's  fables  are  anthropomorphic  since  they  all  have  human  feelings  and  thoughts
even  though  they  don't  look  like  humans.  Thus,  when  the  fox  calls  the  grapes  sour  simply  because
they're out of reach, it's a very human response. Thousands of years after Aesop, anthropomorphism
is  still  alive  and  well,  in  the  animal  stories  of  Beatrix  Potter,  George  Orwell's  Animal Farm,  and
hundreds of cartoons and comic strips.

- [[metamorphosis]] 
(2) A developmental change in an animal that occurs after birth or hatching. 

 (1) A physical change, especially one supernaturally caused.

• Day by day the class watched the gradual metamorphosis of the tadpoles into frogs. 

Many ancient myths end in a metamorphosis. As Apollo is chasing the nymph Daphne, she calls on
her river-god father for help and he turns her into a laurel tree to save her. Out of anger and jealousy,
the  goddess  Athena  turns  the  marvelous  weaver  Arachne  into  a  spider  that  will  spin  only  beautiful
webs. But natural substances may also metamorphose, or undergo metamorphosis. Heat and pressure
over thousands of years may eventually turn tiny organisms into petroleum, and coal into diamonds.
And the most beloved of natural metamorphoses (notice how this plural is formed) is probably the
transformation of caterpillars into butterflies.

- [[morphology]] 
study of word formation. 

 (1) The study of the structure and form of plants and animals. (2) The

• The morphology of the mouthparts of the different mayfly species turns out to be closely related to
what they feed on and their methods of eating. 

Within  the  field  of  biology,  morphology  is  the  study  of  the  shapes  and  arrangement  of  parts  of
organisms,  in  order  to  determine  their  function,  their  development,  and  how  they  may  have  been
shaped by evolution. Morphology is particularly important in classifying species, since it can often
reveal how closely one species is related to another. Morphology is studied within other sciences as
well, including astronomy and geology. And in language, morphology considers where words come
from and why they look the way they do.

- FORM is the Latin root meaning “shape” or “form.” When you march in formation, you're moving in
