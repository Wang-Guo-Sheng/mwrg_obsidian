TERM/TERMIN comes from the Latin verb terminare,  “to  limit,  bound,  or  set  limits  to,”  and  the
noun terminus,  “limit  or  boundary.”  In  English,  those  boundaries  or  limits  tend  to  be  final.  A  term
goes  on  for  a  given  amount  of  time  and  then  ends,  and  to  terminate  a  sentence  or  a  meeting  or  a
ballgame means to end it.

- [[terminal]] 

 (1) Forming or relating to an end or limit. (2) Fatal. 

• She knows she's in the late stages of a terminal illness, and has already drawn up a will. 

A  terminal  disease  ends  in  death.  If  you're  terminally  bored,  you're  “bored  to  death.”  For  many
students,  a  high-school  diploma  is  their  terminal  degree  (others  finish  college  before  terminating
their  education).  A  bus  or  train  terminal  is  the  endpoint  of  the  line.  A  computer  terminal  was
originally the endpoint of a line connecting to a central computer. A terminal ornament may mark the
end of a building, and terminal punctuation ends this sentence.

- [[indeterminate]] 

 Not precisely determined; vague. 

• The police are looking for a tall white bearded man of indeterminate age who should be considered
armed and dangerous. 

When you determine something, you decide on what it is, which means you put limits or boundaries
on its identity. So something indeterminate lacks identifying limits. A mutt is usually the product of
indeterminate  breeding,  since  at  least  the  father's  identity  is  generally  a  mystery.  A  painting  of
indeterminate  origins  is  normally  less  valued  than  one  with  the  painter's  name  on  it.  And  if
negotiations are left in an indeterminate state, nothing has been decided.

- [[interminable]] 

 Having or seeming to have no end; tiresomely drawn out. 

• The preacher was making another of his interminable pleas for money, so she snapped off the TV. 

Nothing is literally endless, except maybe the universe and time itself, so interminable as we use it is
always  an  exaggeration.  On  an  unlucky  day  you  might  sit  through  an  interminable  meeting,  have  an
interminable drive home in heavy traffic, and watch an interminable film—all in less than 24 hours.

- [[terminus]] 
end of a route. (2) An extreme point; tip. 

 (1) The end of a travel route (such as a rail or bus line), or the station at the

• They've been tracking the terminus of the glacier for 20 years, in which time it has retreated 500
yards. 

This word comes straight from Latin. In the Roman empire, a terminus was a boundary stone, and all
boundary stones had a minor god associated with them, whose name was Terminus. Terminus was a
kind of keeper of the peace, since wherever there was a terminus there could be no arguments about
where  your  property  ended  and  your  neighbor's  property  began.  So  Terminus  even  had  his  own
festival, the Terminalia, when images of the god were draped with flower garlands. Today the word
shows  up  in  all  kinds  of  places,  including  in  the  name  of  numerous  hotels  worldwide  built  near  a
city's railway terminus.
