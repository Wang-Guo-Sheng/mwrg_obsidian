- TUT/TUI comes from a Latin verb meaning “to look after,” and in English the root generally shows
up  in  words  that  include  the  meaning  “guide,”  “guard,”  or  “teach”—such  as  tutor,  the  name  for  a
private teacher who guides a student (or tutee) through a subject.

- [[tutorial]] 
program that gives information about a specific subject. 

 (1) A class for one student or a small group of students. (2) An instructional

• He'd been taking tutorials with the same graduate student for two years, and learning far more than
he'd ever learned in his large classes. 

Tutorials with live tutors are useful for both advanced students and struggling ones. Many computer
programs include electronic tutorials to help the new user get used to the program, leading him or her
through all its functions, often by means of pictures and short videos. But a really difficult program
may still require a real-life tutor to be fully understood.

- [[tuition]] 

 (1) The act of teaching; instruction. (2) The cost of or payment for instruction. 

• As she happily flipped through her college catalogs, her parents sat quietly but uneasily calculating
the total tuition costs. 

The sense of tuition meaning “teaching” or “instruction” is mostly used in Britain today. In the U.S.,
tuition almost always means the costs charged by a school, college, or university for that teaching.
Those  costs  have  tended  to  rise  at  an  alarming  rate  in  recent  years.  Around  2010  a  student  could
receive a four-year college education (tuition, room, and board) at an inexpensive public university
for less than $50,000, but might have to pay more than $200,000 at an expensive private college or
university.

- [[intuition]] 
quick insight. (2) Something known in this way. 

 (1) The power of knowing something immediately without mental effort;

•  She  scoffed  at  the  notion  of  “women's  intuition,”  special  powers  of  insight  and  understanding  in
personal relations that women are supposed to have. 

Intuition  is  very  close  in  meaning  to  instinct.  The  moment  a  man  enters  a  room  you  may  feel  you
know intuitively or instinctively everything about him—that is, you may intuit his basic personality.
Highly rational people may try to ignore their intuition and insist on being able to explain everything
they think, but artists and creative thinkers often tend to rely on their intuitive sense of things. Intuition
can be closely related to their imagination, which seems to come from somewhere just as mysterious.
Some psychologists claim that the left brain is mainly involved in logical thinking and the right brain
in intuitive thinking; but the brain is terribly complex, and even if there's some truth to this idea, it's
not terribly obvious how to make use of it.

- [[tutelage]] 

 Instruction or guidance of an individual; guardianship. 

• Under the old man's expert tutelage, they had learned to carve and paint beautiful and realistic duck
decoys. 

Tutelage  usually  means  specialized  and  individual  guidance.  Alexander  the  Great  was  under  the
tutelage of the philosopher Aristotle between the ages of 13 and 16, and his tutor inspired him with a
love of philosophy, medicine, and science. At 16 he commanded his first army, and by his death 16
years later he had founded the greatest empire ever seen. But it's not so easy to trace the effects of the
brilliant tutelage he had received in his youth.
