- GEO comes from the Greek word for “Earth.” Geography is the science that deals with features of
the Earth's surface. Geologists study rocks and soil to learn about the Earth's history and resources.
Geometry was originally about measuring portions of the Earth's surface, probably originally in order
to determine where the boundaries of Egyptians' farms lay after the annual flooding by the Nile River.

- [[geocentric]] 

 Having or relating to the Earth as the center. 

• He claims that, if you aren't a scientist, your consciousness is mostly geocentric for your entire life. 

The idea that the Earth is the center of the universe and that the sun revolves around it is an ancient
one,  probably  dating  back  to  the  earliest  humans.  Not  until  1543  did  the  Polish  astronomer
Copernicus  publish  his  calculations  proving  that  the  Earth  actually  revolves  around  the  sun,  thus
replacing the geocentric model with a heliocentric model (from Helios, the Greek god of the sun).
But geocentrism remains central to various religious sects around the world, and still today one in
five adult Americans believes the sun revolves around the Earth.

- [[geophysics]] 
occurring especially in the Earth and in its vicinity. 

  The  science  that  deals  with  the  physical  processes  and  phenomena

• Located in the heart of oil and gas country, the university offers a degree in geophysics and many of
its graduates go straight to work for the oil and gas industry. 

Geophysics applies the principles of physics to the study of the Earth. It deals with such things as the
movement of the Earth's crust and the temperatures of its interior. Another subject is the behavior of
the still-mysterious geomagnetic field. Some geophysicists seek out deposits of ores or petroleum;
others  specialize  in  earthquakes;  still  others  study  the  water  beneath  the  Earth's  surface,  where  it
collects and how it flows.

- [[geostationary]] 
fixed position above the Earth, especially having such an orbit above the equator. 

  Being  or  having  an  orbit  such  that  a  satellite  remains  in  a

•  It  was  the  science-fiction  writer  Arthur  C.  Clarke  who  first  conceived  of  a  set  of  geostationary
satellites as a means of worldwide communication. 

We don't give much thought to geostationary satellites, but many of us rely on them daily. Anyone who
watches satellite TV or listens to satellite radio is dependent on them; the weather photos you see on
TV  are  taken  from  geostationary  satellites;  and  military  information  gathering  via  satellite  goes  on
quietly  day  after  day.  (Though  the  satellites  that  provide  GPS  service  for  your  car  or  cell  phone
actually aren't geostationary, since they orbit the Earth twice a day.) By 2009 there were about 300
geostationary satellites in operation, all of them moving at an altitude of about 22,000 miles. Since
they hover above the same spot on Earth, your receiving dish or antenna doesn't have to turn in order
to track them.

- [[geothermal]] 

 Of, relating to, or using the natural heat produced inside the Earth. 

• Geothermal power plants convert underground water or steam to electricity. 

Geothermal comes partly from the Greek thermos, “hot” (see THERM/THERMO). Most geothermal
electricity  is  provided  by  power  plants  situated  in  areas  where  there  is  significant  activity  of  the
Earth's  great  tectonic  plates—often  the  same  areas  where  volcanoes  are  found.  But  hot  water  from
deep  underground  may  be  used  by  cities  far  from  volcanoes  to  heat  buildings  or  sidewalks.  And  a
newer source of geothermal energy relies on a less dramatic kind of heat: Individual homeowners can
now install heat pumps that take advantage of the 50°-60° temperature of the soil near the surface to
provide heating in cold weather (and air-conditioning in the warm months). These very small-scale
geothermal systems may eventually supply more useful energy than the large power plants.
