- DOC/DOCT comes from the Latin docere, which means “to teach.” So, for instance, a doctor was
originally  a  highly  educated  person  capable  of  instructing  others  in  a  field—which  usually  wasn't
medicine.

- [[doctrine]] 

 (1) Something that is taught. (2) An official principle, opinion, or belief. 

•  According  to  the  19th-century  doctrine  of  “papal  infallibility,”  a  pope's  official  statements  on
matters of faith and morals must be regarded as the absolute truth. 

The  original  doctrines  were  those  of  the  Catholic  Church,  especially  as  taught  by  the  so-called
doctors (religious scholars) of the Church. But today a doctrine can come from many other sources.
Old and established legal principles are called legal doctrine. Traditional psychiatrists still follow
the doctrines of Sigmund Freud. Communist doctrine in the 1920s and '30s was often the teachings of
Lenin,  which  were  then  regarded  in  the  Soviet  Union  as  almost  sacred.  U.S.  presidents  have  given
their  names  to  doctrines  as  well:  In  1823  the  Monroe  Doctrine  stated  that  the  United  States  would
oppose  European  influence  in  the  Americas,  and  in  1947  the  Truman  Doctrine  held  that  America
would support free countries against enemies outside and inside.

 (1) Teacher, lecturer. (2) A person who leads guided tours, especially through a

•  Visitors  to  Istanbul's  great  Topkapi  Museum  often  decide  they  need  to  hire  an  English-speaking
docent. 

The title of docent is used in many countries for what Americans would call an associate professor—
that is, a college or university teacher who has been given tenure (see tenure) but hasn't yet achieved
the rank of full professor. But in the U.S. a docent is a guide who works at a museum, a historical site,
or even a zoo or a park. Docents are usually volunteers, and their services are often free of charge.

- [[doctrinaire]] 
difficulties or individual circumstance. 

  Tending  to  apply  principles  or  theories  without  regard  for  practical

•  She  had  never  taken  a  doctrinaire  approach  to  teaching,  since  education  theories  didn't  always
match the reality of instructing 25 lively students. 

Someone doctrinaire sticks closely to official doctrines or principles. A doctrinaire judge will give
identical sentences to everyone found guilty of a particular crime. A doctrinaire feminist may treat all
men  as  if  they  were  identical.  A  doctrinaire  economist  might  call  for  a  single  solution  for  the
economic  problems  in  all  countries,  regardless  of  their  social  and  cultural  history.  As  you  might
guess, the word isn't often used in positive contexts.

- [[indoctrinate]] 
with a particular opinion or point of view. 

 (1) To teach, especially basics or fundamentals. (2) To fill someone

• In the Army's basic training, sergeants have 11 weeks to indoctrinate their new recruits with army
attitudes and discipline. 

Indoctrinate simply means “brainwash” to many people today. We frequently hear, for example, of
religious cults that indoctrinate their members to give up their freedom and individuality and to work
hard only for a leader's goals. But its meaning wasn't originally negative at all. And the fact is that
every society indoctrinates its young people with the values of its culture; in the U.S. we tend to be
indoctrinated  to  love  freedom,  to  be  individuals,  and  to  work  hard  for  success,  among  many  other
things. But we now rarely use indoctrinate (or its noun, indoctrination) in a positive way; instead
we usually stick to the simpler and safer teach or instruct.

- TUT/TUI comes from a Latin verb meaning “to look after,” and in English the root generally shows
