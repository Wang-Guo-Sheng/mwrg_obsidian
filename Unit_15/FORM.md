- FORM is the Latin root meaning “shape” or “form.” When you march in formation, you're moving in
ordered patterns. And a formula is a standard form for expressing information, such as a rule written
in mathematical symbols, or the “Sincerely yours” that often ends a letter.

- [[format]] 
arrangement, or choice of material. 

  (1)  The  shape,  size,  and  general  makeup  of  something.  (2)  A  general  plan,

• The new thesaurus would be published in three formats: as a hardcover book, a large paperback,
and a CD-ROM. 

Format  is  a  word  that  seems  to  gain  more  uses  with  every  decade.  Traditionally,  people  used  the
word simply to refer to the design of a book or newspaper page, but today that's only one of its many
meanings.  TV  news  shows  seem  to  change  their  format,  or  general  form,  as  often  as  their
anchorpeople,  and  show  types  such  as  situation  comedy  and  crime  drama  are  often  called  formats.
When a radio station gives up playing pop music to became a talk station, it's said to be switching
formats.  In  the  electronic  age,  format  has  also  become  widely  used  as  a  verb;  thus,  organizing
electronic data for storage or other special uses is called formatting (or reformatting).

- [[conform]] 
ordinary standards or customs. 

 (1) To be similar or identical; to be in agreement or harmony. (2) To follow

•  My  family  was  too  odd  to  really  conform  to  the  little  town's  ideas  about  proper  behavior,  but  it
didn't seem to bother our neighbors too much. 

Conform,  with  its  prefix  con-,  “with”  or  “together,”  means  basically  “to  adopt  the  form  of  those
around you.” Thus, employee behavior must usually conform with basic company policies. A certain
philosophy may be said to conform with American values (even if we sometimes have a hard time
agreeing on exactly what those are). And a Maine Coon cat or a Dandie Dinmont terrier must conform
to  its  breed  requirements  in  order  to  be  registered  for  breeding  purposes.  Being  a  conformist  is
usually  a  safe  bet;  being  a  nonconformist,  who  ignores  society's  standards  and  the  whole  idea  of
conformity, can be a bit dangerous but also sometimes more fun.

- [[formality]] 
(2) The following of conventional rules. 

 (1) An established custom or way of behaving that is required or standard.

• The bride and groom wanted a small, intimate wedding without all the usual formalities. 

Formal  behavior  follows  the  proper  forms  or  customs,  and  informal  behavior  feels  free  to  ignore
them. The formality of a dinner party is indicated by such formalities as invitations, required dress,
and  full  table  settings.  Legal  formalities,  or  technicalities,  may  turn  out  to  be  all-important  even  if
they often seem minor. America requires fewer formalities than many other countries (in Germany, for
example, you may know someone for years before using his or her first name), but even in relaxed
situations Americans may be observing invisible formalities.

- [[formative]] 
important growth or development. 

 (1) Giving or able to give form or shape; constructive. (2) Having to do with

• She lived in Venezuela during her formative years and grew up speaking both Spanish and English. 

Whatever gives shape to something else may be called formative: for example, the Grand Canyon is a
product of the formative power of water, and the automobile was a huge formative influence on the
design  of  America's  cities.  But  it  usually  applies  to  some  kind  of  shaping  that  isn't  physical.  An
ambitious plan, for example, goes through a formative stage of development. The formative years of
the  U.S.  included  experimentation  with  various  forms  of  government.  And  the  most  important
formative experiences in our own lives tend to take place in the first 20 years or so.
