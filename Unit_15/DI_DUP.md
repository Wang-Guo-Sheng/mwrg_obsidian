DI/DUP, Greek and Latin prefixes meaning “two,” show up in both technical and nontechnical terms,
with dup- [[sometimes]] shortened to du-. So a duel is a battle between two people. A duet is music for
a duo, or pair of musicians. A duplicate is an exact copy, or twin. And if you have dual citizenship,
you belong to two countries at once.

- [[dichotomy]] 
qualities that seem to contradict each other. 

  (1)  A  division  into  two  often  contradictory  groups.  (2)  Something  with

• Already in her first job, she noticed a dichotomy between the theories she'd been taught in college
and the realities of professional life. 

In  the  modern  world  there's  a  dichotomy  between  fast  and  intense  big-city  life  and  the  slower  and
more  relaxed  life  in  the  country.  But  the  dichotomy  is  nothing  new:  the  Roman  poet  Horace  was
complaining about it in the 1st century B.C. Among other eternal dichotomies, there's the dichotomy
between  wealth  and  poverty,  between  the  policies  of  the  leading  political  parties,  between  a
government's words and its actions—and between what would be most fun to do right this minute and
what would be the mature and sensible alternative.

- [[dimorphic]] 

 Occurring in two distinguishable forms (as of color or size). 

• One of a birder's challenges is identifying birds of the less colorful sex in dimorphic species. 

Dimorphism varies greatly in the animal kingdom. Among mammals, the male is generally larger than
the  female,  but  other  differences  in  appearance  tend  to  be  modest.  But  birds  are  usually  noticeably
dimorphic,  with  the  male  being  the  more  colorful  sex;  when  we  imagine  a  pheasant,  a  mallard,  a
cardinal, or a peacock, we're almost always picturing the male rather than the female. Among spiders
the  situation  is  often  reversed.  The  golden  orb-weaver  spider,  for  example,  is  spectacularly
dimorphic:  the  female  may  be  20  times  the  size  of  the  male,  and  she  usually  ends  up  eating  him,
sometimes  even  while  he's  mating  with  her.  Many  sea  creatures,  including  many  fish,  take  care  of
gender problems by simply changing from one sex into the other.

- [[duplex]] 
communication in two directions at the same time. 

  (1)  Having  two  principal  elements;  double.  (2)  Allowing  electronic

• The upper floor of their splendid duplex apartment had a panoramic view of Paradise Park. 

Duplex can describe a confusing variety of things, depending on the technical field. Most of us use it
as a noun: a duplex can be either a two-family house or a two-story apartment. In computer science
and  telecommunications,  duplex  (or  full-duplex)  communication  can  go  in  both  directions  at  once,
while half-duplex communication can go only one way at a time. In other areas, just translate duplex
as “double” and see if the sentence makes sense.

- [[duplicity]] 

 Deception by pretending to feel and act one way while acting in another. 

• By the time Jackie's duplicity in the whole matter had come to light, she had left town, leaving no
forwarding address. 

The Greek god Zeus often resorted to duplicity to get what he wanted, and most of the time what he
wanted was some woman. His duplicity usually involved a disguise: he appeared to Leda as a swan,
and to Europa as a bull. Sometimes he had to be duplicitous to get around his wife, Hera. After he
had had his way with Io and was about to get caught, he turned her into a cow to avoid Hera's anger.

- BI/BIN  also  means  “two”  or  “double.”  A  bicycle  has  two  wheels,  and  binoculars  consist  of  two
