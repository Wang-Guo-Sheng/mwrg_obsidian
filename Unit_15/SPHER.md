- SPHER comes from the Greek word for “ball.” A ball is itself a sphere, as is the ball that we call
Earth. So is the atmosphere, and so are several other invisible “spheres” that encircle the Earth.

- [[spherical]] 

 Relating to a sphere; shaped like a sphere or one of its segments. 

• The girls agreed that the spacecraft had been deep blue and perfectly spherical, and that its alien
passengers had resembled large praying mantises. 

Something  spherical  is  like  a  sphere  in  being  round,  or  more  or  less  round,  in  three  dimensions.
Apples  and  oranges  are  both  spherical,  for  example,  even  though  they're  never  perfectly  round.  A
spheroid  has  a  roughly  spherical  shape;  so  an  asteroid,  for  instance,  is  often  spheroidal—fairly
round, but lumpy.

- [[stratosphere]] 
about 30 miles above the surface. (2) A very high or the highest region. 

 (1) The part of the earth's atmosphere that extends from about seven to

•  In  the  celebrity  stratosphere  she  now  occupied,  a  fee  of  12  million  dollars  per  film  was  a
reasonable rate. 

The stratosphere (strato- [[simply]] means “layer” or “level”) lies above the earth's weather and mostly
changes very little. It contains the ozone layer, which shields us from the sun's ultraviolet radiation
except  where  it's  been  harmed  by  manmade  chemicals.  The  levels  of  the  atmosphere  are  marked
particularly  by  their  temperatures;  stratospheric  temperatures  rise  only  to  around  32°—very
moderate  considering  that  temperatures  in  the  troposphere  below  may  descend  to  about  -70°  and
those in the ionosphere above may rise to 1000°.

- [[biosphere]] 
environment. 

 (1) The part of the world in which life can exist. (2) Living things and their

• The moon has no biosphere, so an artificial one would have to be constructed for any long-term stay.

The lithosphere is the solid surface of the earth (lith- [[meaning]] “rock”); the hydrosphere is the earth's
water (hydro- [[means]] “water”), including the clouds and water vapor in the air; and the atmosphere is
the earth's air (atmos- [[meaning]] “vapor”). The term biosphere can include all of these, along with the
10 million species of living things they contain. The biosphere recycles its air, water, organisms, and
minerals constantly to maintain an amazingly balanced state; human beings should probably do their
best to imitate it. Though the word has a new sound to it, it was first used over a hundred years ago.

- [[hemisphere]] 
or a meridian. 

 Half a sphere, especially half the global sphere as divided by the equator

• A sailor who crosses the equator from the northern to the southern hemisphere for the first time is
traditionally given a special initiation. 

Hemisphere  includes  the  prefix  hemi-,  meaning  “half.”  The  northern  and  southern  hemispheres  are
divided  by  the  equator,  the  circle  halfway  between  Earth's  two  poles.  The  eastern  and  western
hemispheres  aren't  divided  so  exactly,  since  there  are  no  poles  in  the  Earth's  east-west  dimension.
Often the dividing line is said to be the “prime meridian”—the imaginary north-south line that runs
through Greenwich, England, from which all longitude is calculated (itself being the 0° meridian). But
for simplicity's sake, the eastern hemisphere is often said to include all of Europe, Africa, Australia,
and Asia, while the western hemisphere contains North and South America and a great deal of ocean.

- VERT  comes  from  the  Latin  verb  vertere,  meaning  “to  turn”  or  “to  turn  around.”  Vertigo  is  the
