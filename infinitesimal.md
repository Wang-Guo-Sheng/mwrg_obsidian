Extremely or immeasurably small. 

• Looking more closely at the research data, he now saw an odd pattern of changes so infinitesimal
that they hadn't been noticed before. 

Just  as  infinite  describes  something  immeasurable  (“without  limit”),  infinitesimal  describes something  endlessly  small.  When  Antonie  van  Leeuwenhoek  invented  the  microscope  in  the  17th
century,  he  was  able  to  see  organisms  that  had  been  thought  too  infinitesimally  small  to  exist.  But today's electron microscope allows us to see infinitesimal aspects of matter that even Leeuwenhoek could not have imagined.
