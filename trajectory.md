The  curved  path  that  an  object  makes  in  space,  or  that  a  thrown  object follows as it rises and falls to earth. 

• Considering the likely range, trajectory, and accuracy of a bullet fired from a cheap handgun at 100
yards, the murder seemed incredible. 

Formed with part of the prefix trans-, “across,” trajectory means a “hurling across.” By calculating
the effect of gravity and other forces, the trajectory of an object launched into space at a known speed can be computed precisely. Missiles stand a chance of hitting their target only if their trajectory has been plotted accurately. The word is used most often in physics and engineering, but not always; we can also say, for example, that the trajectory of a whole life may be set in a person's youth, or that a
new book traces the long trajectory of the French empire.
