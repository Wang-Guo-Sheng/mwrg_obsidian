Noticeable or able to be felt by the senses. 

•  Her  change  in  attitude  toward  him  was  barely  perceptible,  and  he  couldn't  be  sure  he  wasn't  just imagining it. 

Perceptible includes the prefix per-, meaning “through,” so the word refers to **whatever can be taken in through the senses**. A **perceptive** person picks up minor changes, small clues, or hints and shades of meaning that others can't perceive, so one person's perception—a tiny sound, a slight change in the weather, a different tone of voice—often won't be perceptible to another.
