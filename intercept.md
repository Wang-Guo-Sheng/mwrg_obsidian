制止，拦截，截获（信件、传球、船只）

To stop, seize, or interrupt (something or someone) before arrival. 

• The explosives had been intercepted by police just before being loaded onto the jet. 

Since the prefix inter means “between” (see INTER), it's not hard to see how intercept was created.
Arms shipments coming to a country are sometimes intercepted, but such interceptions can sometimes be understood as acts of war. In football, soccer, and basketball, players try to intercept the ball as it's  being  passed  by  the  other  team.  In  years  gone  by,  letters  and  documents  being  carried  between officers  or officials  were  sometimes intercepted  when  the  carrier  was  caught;  today,  when  these
communications are generally electronic, an intercepted e-mail isn't actually stopped, but simply read secretly by a third party.
