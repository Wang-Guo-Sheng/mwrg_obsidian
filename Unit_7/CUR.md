- CUR, from the Latin verb curare, means basically “care for.” Our verb cure comes from this root, as
do manicure (“care of the hands”) and pedicure (“care of the feet”).

- [[curative]] 

 Having to do with curing diseases. 

• As soon as the antibiotic entered his system, he imagined he could begin to feel its curative effects. 

Medical researchers are finding curative substances in places that surprise them. Folklore has led to
some  “new”  cures  of  old  diseases,  and  natural  substances  never  before  tried  have  often  proved
effective. Quinine, which comes from a tree in the Andes, was the original drug for malaria; aspirin's
main  ingredient  came  from  willow  bark;  and  Taxol,  a  drug  used  in  treating  several  cancers,  was
originally  extracted  from  the  bark  of  a  yew  tree.  The  curative  properties  of  these  natural  drugs  are
today duplicated in the laboratory.

- [[curator]] 
collection, a museum, or a zoo. 

  Someone  in  charge  of  something  where  things  are  on  exhibit,  such  as  a

•  In  recent  decades,  zoo  curators  have  tried  to  make  the  animals'  surroundings  more  and  more  like
their natural homes. 

In  a  good-sized  art  museum,  each  curator  is  generally  responsible  for  a  single  department  or
collection:  European  painting,  Asian  sculpture,  Native  American  art,  and  so  on.  Curatorial  duties
include acquiring new artworks, caring for and repairing objects already owned, discovering frauds
and  counterfeits,  lending  artworks  to  other  museums,  and  mounting  exhibitions  of  everything  from
Greek sculpture to 20th-century clothing.

- [[procure]] 

 To get possession of; obtain. 

• Investigators were looking into the question of how the governor had procured such a huge loan at
such a favorable rate. 

While procure has the general meaning of “obtain,” it usually implies that some effort is required. It
may  also  suggest  getting  something  through  a  formal  set  of  procedures.  In  many  business  offices,  a
particular  person  is  responsible  for  procuring  supplies,  and  government  agencies  have  formal
procurement policies. When teenagers use an older friend to procure the wrong kind of supplies for
their parties, they often risk getting into trouble.

- [[sinecure]] 

 A job or position requiring little work but usually providing some income. 

•  The  job  of  Dean  of  Students  at  any  college  is  no  sinecure;  the  hours  can  be  long  and  the  work
draining. 

Sinecure contains the Latin word sine, “without,” and thus means “without care.” In some countries,
the government in power may be free to award sinecure positions to their valued supporters; in other
countries, this would be regarded as corruption. The positions occupied by British royalty are called
sinecures by some people, who claim they enjoy their enormous wealth in return for nothing at all.
But their many supporters point to the amount of public-service, charitable, and ceremonial work they
perform, not to mention the effort they put into promoting Britain to the world.

- PERI, in both Latin and Greek, means “around.” A period is often a span of time that keeps coming
