- PERI, in both Latin and Greek, means “around.” A period is often a span of time that keeps coming
around  regularly,  day  after  day  or  year  after  year.  With  a  periscope,  you  can  see  around  corners.
Peristalsis is the process that moves food around the intestines; without it, digestion would grind to a
halt.

- [[perimeter]] 

 The boundary or distance around a body or figure. 

•  In  a  medieval  siege,  an  army  would  surround  the  perimeter  of  a  city's  high  walls,  denying  the
population any food from outside as it assaulted the walls with catapults and battering rams. 

The  perimeter  of  a  prison  is  ringed  with  high  walls  and  watchtowers,  and  the  entire  perimeter  of
Australia is bounded by water. In geometry, you may be asked to calculate the perimeter of various
geometrical shapes. In basketball, the perimeter is the area beyond the free-throw circle; a “perimeter
player” tends to stay outside that circle. Try not to confuse this word with parameter, which usually
means a rule or limit that controls what something is or how it can be done.

- [[periodontal]] 

 Concerning or affecting the tissues around the teeth. 

• Years of bad living had filled his teeth with cavities, but it was periodontal disease that finished
them off. 

In dentistry, cavities are important but they aren't the whole story; what happens to your gums is every
bit as vital to your dental health. When you don't floss regularly to keep plaque from forming on your
teeth  and  gums,  the  gums  will  slowly  deteriorate.  Dentists  called  periodontists  specialize  in  the
treatment of periodontal problems, and when the gums have broken down to the point where they can't
hold  the  teeth  in  place  a  periodontist  may  need  to  provide  dental  implants,  a  costly  and  unpleasant
process. But even a periodontist can't keep your gums healthy; that job is up to you.

- [[peripatetic]] 
place. 

 (1) Having to do with walking. (2) Moving or traveling from place to

• She spent her early adult years as a peripatetic musician, traveling from one engagement to another. 

The philosopher Aristotle had his school at the Lyceum gymnasium in Athens. The Lyceum may have
resembled the Parthenon in being surrounded by a row of columns, or colonnade, which the Greeks
would have called a peripatoi. Aristotle was also said to have paced slowly while teaching, and the
Greek word for “pacing” was peripatos. And finally, peripatos meant simply “discussion.” Whatever
the  source  of  the  word,  Aristotle  and  his  followers  became  known  as  the  Peripatetics,  and  the
“pacing” sense led to peripatetic's English meaning of traveling or moving about. Johnny Appleseed
is a good example of a peripatetic soul, and peripatetic executives and salespeople today stare into
their laptop computers while endlessly flying from city to city.

- [[peripheral]] 
Secondary or supplemental. 

 (1) Having to do with the outer edges, especially of the field of vision. (2)

•  Like  most  good  fourth-grade  teachers,  he  had  excellent  peripheral  vision,  and  the  kids  were
convinced that he had eyes in the back of his head. 

Your peripheral vision is the outer area of your field of vision, where you can still detect movement
and  shapes.  It  can  be  very  valuable  when,  for  instance,  you're  driving  into  Chicago  at  rush  hour,
especially when switching lanes. When people call an issue in a discussion peripheral, they mean that
it's  not  of  primary  importance,  and  they're  probably  suggesting  that  everyone  get  back  to  the  main
topic.  Peripheral  is  now  also  a  noun:  computer  peripherals  are  the  added  components—printers,
webcams, microphones, etc.—that increase a computer's capacities.
