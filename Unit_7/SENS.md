- SENS comes from the Latin noun sensus, meaning “feeling” or “sense.” Sense itself obviously comes
straight from the Latin. A sensation is something you sense. And if you're sensitive, you feel or sense
things sharply, maybe even too sharply.

- [[sensor]] 
and responds by transmitting a signal. 

 A device that detects a physical quantity (such as a movement or a beam of light)

• The outdoor lights are triggered by a motion sensor that detects changes in infrared energy given off
by moving human bodies. 

Sensors  are  used  today  almost  everywhere.  Radar  guns  bounce  microwaves  off  moving  cars.  A
burglar  alarm  may  use  a  photosensor  to  detect  when  a  beam  of  light  has  been  broken,  or  may  use
ultrasonic  sound  waves  that  bounce  off  moving  objects.  Still  other  sensors  may  detect  pressure
(barometers) or chemicals (Breathalyzers and smoke detectors). Stud finders, used by carpenters to
locate  wooden  studs  under  a  wall,  may  employ  magnets  or  radar.  Wired  gloves,  which  relay
information  about  the  position  of  the  fingers,  are  used  in  virtual-reality  environments.  A  cheap  car
alarm may be nothing but a shock sensor, in which a strong vibration will cause two metal surfaces to
come together.

- [[desensitize]] 
by something. 

 To cause (someone or something) to react less to or be less affected

•  Even  squeamish  nursing  students  report  becoming  desensitized  to  the  sight  of  blood  after  a  few
months of training. 

Physical  desensitizing  is  something  that  biologists  have  long  been  aware  of.  Basic  training  in  the
armed  forces  tries  to  desensitize  new  recruits  to  pain.  We  can  desensitize  ourselves  to  the  summer
heat by turning off the air conditioning, or become desensitized to the cold by walking barefoot in the
snow. But desensitize is more often used when talking about negative emotions. Parents worry that
their  children  will  be  desensitized  to  violence  by  playing  video  games.  Soldiers  may  become
desensitized  to  death  on  the  battlefield.  Desensitizing  may  be  natural  and  desirable  under  some
circumstances, but maybe not so good in others.

- [[extrasensory]] 

 Not acting or occurring through any of the known senses. 

• A kind of extrasensory capacity seems to tell some soldiers when danger is near. 

Since  extra  means  “outside,  beyond”  (see  EXTRA),  extrasensory  means  basically  “beyond  the
senses.” Extrasensory perception, or ESP, usually includes communication between minds involving
no obvious contact (telepathy), gaining information about something without using the normal senses
(clairvoyance), or predicting the future (precognition). According to polls, about 40% of Americans
believe  in  ESP,  and  many  of  them  have  had  personal  experiences  that  seem  to  prove  its  existence.
When someone jumps into your mind months or years after you had last thought of him or her, and the
next  day  you  learn  that  the  person  has  just  died,  it  can  be  hard  to  convince  yourself  it  was  just
coincidence.  Still,  scientific  attempts  to  prove  the  existence  of  ESP  have  never  been  terribly
successful.

- [[sensuous]] 

 (1) Highly pleasing to the senses. (2) Relating to the senses. 

• Part of what audiences loved about her was the delight she took in the sensuous pleasures of well-
prepared food. 

Sensuous and sensual are close in meaning but not identical, and sensuous was actually coined by the
poet John Milton so that he wouldn't have to use sensual. Sensuous usually implies pleasing of the
senses  by  art  or  similar  means;  great  music,  for  example,  can  be  a  source  of  sensuous  delight.
Sensual, on the other hand, usually describes gratification of the senses or physical appetites as an
end  in  itself;  thus  we  often  think  (perhaps  unfairly)  of  wealthy  Romans  leading  lives  devoted  to
sensual pleasure. You can see why the Puritan Milton might have wanted another word.

- SOPH  come  from  the  Greek  words  meaning  “wise”  and  “wisdom.”  In  English  the  root  sometimes
