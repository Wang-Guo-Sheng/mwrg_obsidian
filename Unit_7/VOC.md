- VOC comes from the Latin words meaning “voice” and “speak.” So a vocal ensemble is a singing
group. A vocation was originally a “calling” from God to do religious work as a priest, monk, or nun,
though today most people use the word just to mean a career. And a vocabulary is a set of words for
speaking.

- [[equivocate]] 
avoid giving a direct answer. 

 (1) To use ambiguous language, especially in order to deceive. (2) To

• As the company directors continued to equivocate, the union prepared to return to the picket lines. 

With its root equi-, meaning “equal,” equivocate suggests speaking on both sides of an issue at the
same time. An equivocal answer is one that manages not to take a stand; an unequivocal answer, by
contrast, is strong and clear. Politicians are famous for equivocating, but equivocation is also typical
of  used-car  salesmen,  nervous  witnesses  in  a  courtroom,  and  guys  whose  girlfriends  ask  them  how
committed they are to a relationship.

- [[irrevocable]] 

 Impossible to call back or retract. 

•  She  had  told  him  she  wasn't  going  to  see  him  again,  but  he  couldn't  believe  her  decision  was
irrevocable. 

Irrevocable has a formal sound to it and is often used in legal contexts. Irrevocable trusts are trust
funds that cannot be dissolved by the people who created them (the other kind is a revocable trust).
An  irrevocable  credit  is  an  absolute  obligation  from  a  bank  to  provide  credit  to  a  customer.
Irrevocable gifts, under U.S. tax law, are gifts that are given by one living person to another and can't
be  reclaimed  by  the  giver.  But  the  word  isn't  always  legal;  we've  all  had  to  make  irrevocable
decisions, decisions that commit us absolutely to something.

- [[advocate]] 

 To speak in favor of. 

•  Our  lawyer  is  advocating  a  suit  against  the  state,  but  most  of  us  would  rather  try  some  other
approaches first. 

The verb advocate may be followed by for (“advocated for better roads,” “advocated for merging the
two  school  districts”)  or  by  a  noun  or  gerund  (“advocating  an  increase  in  the  military  budget,”
“advocated closing the budget gap”). But advocate isn't only a verb: An advocate is someone who
advocates for you, or argues on your side. Originally, this was often a lawyer in court, and in Britain
advocate is still a term for “lawyer.”

- [[vociferous]] 

 Making noisy or emphatic outcries. 

• Whenever the referee at these soccer games makes a questionable call, you hear vociferous protests
from half the parents. 

A vociferous group shouts loudly and insistently, and they're usually not too happy about something.
So, for example, we often hear about vociferous critics, vociferous demands, vociferous opponents,
or a vociferous minority. When a small group makes itself vociferous enough, everyone else may even
start thinking it's actually a majority.

- PHON  is  a  Greek  root  meaning  “sound,”  “voice,”  or  “speech.”  It's  probably  most  familiar  in  the
