- SPECT  comes  from  the  Latin  verb  specere,  meaning  “to  look  at,”  and  produces  several  familiar
English  words.  Spectacles  can  be  glasses  that  you  look  through;  but  a  spectacle  can  also  be  a
remarkable  sight—in  Roman  times,  perhaps  a  spectacular  chariot  race  or  a  spectacularly  bloody
battle between gladiators and wild beasts, mounted for the pleasure of its spectators.

- [[aspect]] 
regarded. 

 (1) A part of something. (2) A certain way in which something appears or may be

•  Many  experts  believe  the  mental  aspect  of  distance  racing  is  more  important  than  the  physical
aspect. 

Since aspectus  in  Latin  means  “looked  at,”  an  aspect  of  something  is  basically  the  direction  from
which it's looked at. So we may say that travel is your favorite aspect of your job, or that eating well
is one aspect of a healthy life. If you look at a stage set from the front, it looks completely different
than  from  behind,  where  all  the  mechanisms  are  visible,  and  both  aspects  are  important.  The  word
can  be  very  useful  when  you're  analyzing  something,  and  it's  used  a  great  deal  in  the  writings  of
scholars.

- [[prospect]] 
opportunity for something to happen. 

  (1)  The  possibility  that  something  will  happen  in  the  future.  (2)  An

• There was little prospect of a breakthrough in the negotiations before the elections. 

Since  the  Latin  prefix  pro-  often  means  “forward”  (see  PRO), prospect  refers  to  looking  forward.
The prospect of a recession may lead investors to pull their money out of the stock market. Graduates
of a good law school usually have excellent prospects for finding employment. Prospective students
roam campuses with their parents in the year before they plan to enter college.

- [[perspective]] 
  (1)  Point  of  view;  the  angle,  direction,  or  standpoint  from  which  a
person looks at something. (2) The art or technique of painting or drawing a scene so that objects in it
seem to have depth and distance. 

• From the perspective of the lowly soldier, the war looked very different. 

To the modern mind, it's hard to believe that perspective had to be “discovered,” but before the 1400s
paintings  simply  lacked  accurate  perspective.  Instead,  important  people  and  objects  were  simply
shown larger than less important ones; and although distant objects were sometimes shown smaller
than  near  ones,  this  wasn't  done  in  a  regular  and  accurate  way.  Just  as  odd,  many  paintings  didn't
represent the other meaning of perspective either—that is, a scene might not be shown as if it were
being seen from one single place. Today, perspective is used much like standpoint. Just as standpoint
once used to mean simply the physical place where you stand but today also means the way you “see”
things as a result of who you are and what you do, the same could be said about perspective.

- [[prospectus]] 
a stock offering) and is sent out to people who may be interested in buying or investing. 

 A printed statement that describes something (such as a new business or

• The prospectus for the mutual fund says nothing about how its profit forecasts were calculated. 

Like prospect, prospectus looks forward. Thus, a prospectus originally outlined something that didn't
yet exist, describing what it would become. This might even be a book; the great dictionary of Noah
Webster, like that of Samuel Johnson, was first announced in the form of a prospectus, so that well-to-
do people might actually subscribe to it—that is, pay for it in advance so that Webster would have
money to live on while writing it. Soon, prospectus was being used to mean a description of a private
school or college, intended to attract new students. Today the word very often means a description of
a stock offering or mutual fund, whether new or not.
