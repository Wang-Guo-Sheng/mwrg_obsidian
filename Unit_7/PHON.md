- PHON  is  a  Greek  root  meaning  “sound,”  “voice,”  or  “speech.”  It's  probably  most  familiar  in  the
form of the English suffix -phone, in words that begin with a Greek or Latin root as well. Thus, the
tele-  in  telephone  means  “far,”  the  micro-  in  microphone  means  “small,”  the  xylo-  in  xylophone
means “wood,” and so on.

- [[phonics]] 
characteristic sounds of letters, letter groups, and especially syllables. 

  A  method  of  teaching  beginners  to  read  and  pronounce  words  by  learning  the

• My son's school switched to phonics instruction several years ago, and reading achievement in the
early grades has been improving. 

In  the  field  of  beginning  reading,  there  are  two  basic  schools  of  thought  in  the  U.S.  today.  One
emphasizes  “whole  language”  teaching,  which  relies  on  teaching  a  lot  of  reading;  the  other
emphasizes phonics, teaching how letters and syllables correspond to sounds. Phonics instruction may
be  especially  difficult  in  English,  since  English  has  the  most  difficult  spelling  of  any  Western
language. Consider the various ways we create the f sound in cough, photo, and giraffe,  or  the  sh
sound in special, issue, vicious, and portion, or the k sound in tack, quite, and shellac, and how we
pronounce  the  o  in  do,  core,  lock,  and  bone,  or  the  ea  in  lead,  ocean,  idea,  and  early.  Teaching
phonics obviously isn't an easy job, but it's probably an important one.

- [[phonetic]] 

 Relating to or representing the sounds of the spoken language. 

• In almost every Spanish word the pronunciation is clear from the spelling, so the phonetic part of
learning Spanish isn't usually a big challenge. 

The  English  alphabet  is  phonetic—that  is,  the  letters  represent  sounds.  The  Chinese  alphabet,
however, isn't phonetic, since its symbols represent ideas rather than sounds. But even in English, a
letter  doesn't  always  represent  the  same  sound;  the  “a”  in  cat,  father,  and  mate,  for  example,
represents  three  different  sounds.  Because  of  this,  books  about  words  often  use  specially  created
phonetic  alphabets  in  which  each  symbol  stands  for  a  single  sound  in  order  to  represent
pronunciations. So in this book, cat, father, and mate would be phonetically represented as

- [[polyphonic]] 
played against each other in harmony. 

 Referring to a style of music in which two or more melodies are sung or

•  Whenever  he  needed  something  calming,  he  would  put  on  some  quiet  polyphonic  music  from  the
Renaissance and just let the voices waft over him. 

Since poly- [[means]] “many” (see POLY), polyphonic music has “many voices.” In polyphony, each part
has its own melody, and they weave together in a web that may become very dense; a famous piece by
Thomas  Tallis,  composed  around  1570,  has  40  separate  voice  parts.  Polyphony  reached  its  height
during  the  16th  century  with  Italian  madrigals  and  the  sacred  music  of  such  composers  as  Tallis,
Palestrina, and Byrd. Usually when we speak of polyphony we're talking about music of Bach's time
and  earlier;  but  the  principles  remain  the  same  today,  and  songwriters  such  as  the  Beatles  have
sometimes used polyphony as well.

- [[cacophony]] 

 Harsh or unpleasant sound. 

•  In  New  York  she  was  often  dragged  off  by  her  boyfriend  to  downtown  jazz  concerts,  where  she
struggled to make sense of what sounded like nothing but cacophony. 

Cacophony employs the Greek prefix caco-, meaning “bad,” but not everything we call cacophonous
is necessarily bad. Grunge, thrash, hardcore, and goth music are unlistenable to some people and very
popular  to  others.  Open-air  food  markets  may  be  marked  by  a  cacophony  of  voices  but  also  by
wonderful  sights  and  sounds.  On  the  other  hand,  few  people  can  really  enjoy,  for  more  than  a  few
minutes, the cacophony of jackhammers, car horns, and truck engines that assaults the city pedestrian
on a hot day in August.
