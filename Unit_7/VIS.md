VIS  comes  from  a  Latin  verb  meaning  “see.”  Vision  is  what  enables  us  to  see,  visual  images  are
visible to our eyes, and a visitor is someone who comes to see something. The same verb actually
gives us another root, vid-, as in Julius Caesar's famous statement about his military exploits, “Veni,
vidi, vici” (“I came, I saw, I conquered”), and such common English words as video.

- [[vista]] 

 (1) A distant view. (2) An extensive mental view, as over a stretch of time. 

•  The  economic  vista  for  the  next  two  years  looks  excellent,  according  to  a  poll  of  business
economists. 

Vista is generally used today for broad sweeping views of the kind you might see from a mountaintop.
But the word originally meant an avenue-like view, narrowed by a line of trees on either side. And
vista has also long been used (like view and outlook) to mean a mental scan of the future—as if you
were riding down a long grand avenue and what you could see a mile or so ahead of you was where
you'd be in the very near future.

- [[vis]]-à-vis 

 In relation to or compared with. 

•  Many  financial  reporters  worry  about  the  loss  of  U.S.  economic  strength  vis-à-vis  our  principal
trading partners. 

Vis-à-vis comes from Latin by way of French, where it means literally “face-to-face.” In English it
was  first  used  to  mean  a  little  horse-drawn  carriage  in  which  two  people  sat  opposite  each  other.
From there it acquired various other meanings, such as “dancing partner.” Today it no longer refers to
actual physical faces and bodies, but its modern meaning comes from the fact that things that are face-
to-face can easily be compared or contrasted. So, for example, a greyhound is very tall vis-à-vis a
Scottie, and the Red Sox have often fared badly vis-à-vis the Yankees.

- [[visionary]] 
are often impractical. 

 (1) A person with foresight and imagination. (2) A dreamer whose ideas

• His followers regarded him as an inspired visionary; his opponents saw him as either a con man or
a lunatic. 

A visionary is someone with a strong vision of the future. Since such visions aren't always accurate, a
visionary's  ideas  may  either  work  brilliantly  or  fail  miserably.  Even  so,  visionary  is  usually  a
positive word. Martin Luther King, Jr., for instance, was a visionary in his hopes and ideas for a just
society.  The  word  is  also  an  adjective;  thus,  for  example,  we  may  speak  of  a  visionary  project,  a
visionary leader, a visionary painter, or a visionary company.

- [[envisage]] 

 To have a mental picture of; visualize. 

• A mere three weeks after they had started dating, the two were already arguing, and none of us could
envisage the relationship lasting for long. 

One of the imagination's most valuable uses is its ability to see something in the “mind's eye”—that
is, to visualize,  envision,  or  envisage  something.  Envisaging  a  possibility  may  be  one  of  the  chief
abilities that separate human beings from the other animals. What we envisage may be physical (such
as a completed piece of furniture) or nonphysical (such as finishing college). Envisaging life with a
puppy might lead us down to the pound to buy one, and envisaging the sinking of an island nation may
focus our minds on climate change.

- SPECT  comes  from  the  Latin  verb  specere,  meaning  “to  look  at,”  and  produces  several  familiar
