- SOPH  come  from  the  Greek  words  meaning  “wise”  and  “wisdom.”  In  English  the  root  sometimes
appears in words where the wisdom is of the “wise guy” variety, but in words such as philosophy we
see it used more respectfully.

- [[sophistry]] 

 Cleverly deceptive reasoning or argument. 

• For lawyers and politicians, the practice of sophistry from time to time is almost unavoidable. 

The  Sophists  were  a  group  of  Greek  teachers  of  rhetoric  and  philosophy,  famous  during  the  5th
century B.C., who moved from town to town offering their teaching for a fee. The Sophists originally
represented a respectable school of philosophy, but some critics claimed that they tried to persuade
by means of clever but misleading arguments. The philosopher Plato wrote negatively about them, and
the  comic  dramatist  Aristophanes  made  fun  of  them,  showing  them  making  ridiculously  fine
distinctions  about  word  meanings.  We  get  our  modern  meanings  of  sophist,  sophistry,  and  the
adjective sophistical mostly from the opinions of these two men.

- [[sophisticated]] 
Highly complex or developed. 

  (1)  Having  a  thorough  knowledge  of  the  ways  of  society.  (2)

•  In  Woman  of  the  Year,  Katharine  Hepburn  plays  a  sophisticated  journalist  who  can  handle
everything except Spencer Tracy. 

A  sophisticated  argument  is  thorough  and  well-worked-out.  A  satellite  is  a  sophisticated  piece  of
technology,  complex  and  designed  to  accomplish  difficult  tasks.  A  sophisticated  person,  such  as
Humphrey  Bogart  in  Casablanca,  knows  how  to  get  around  in  the  world.  But  sophistication  isn't
always  admired.  As  you  might  guess,  the  word  is  closely  related  to  sophistry  (see  above),  and  its
original  meanings  weren't  very  positive,  and  still  today  many  of  us  aren't  sure  we  really  like
sophisticates.

- [[sophomoric]] 
and immature. 

 Overly impressed with one's own knowledge, but in fact undereducated

• We can't even listen to those sophomoric songs of his, with their attempts at profound wisdom that
just demonstrate how little he knows about life. 

Sophomoric  seems  to  include  the  roots  soph-,  “wise,”  and  moros,  “fool”  (seen  in  words  such  as
moron),  so  the  contrast  between  wisdom  and  ignorance  is  built  right  into  the  word.  Cambridge
University introduced the term sophomore for its second-year students in the 17th century (though it's
no longer used in Britain), maybe to suggest that a sophomore has delusions of wisdom since he's no
longer an ignorant freshman. In America today, sophomore is ambiguous since it can refer to either
high  school  or  college.  But  sophomoric  should  properly  describe  something—wit,  behavior,
arguments, etc.—that is at least trying to be sophisticated.

- [[theosophy]] 
especially teachings founded on a blend of Buddhist and Hindu beliefs. 

  A  set  of  teachings  about  God  and  the  world  based  on  mystical  insight,

• He had experimented with a number of faiths, starting with Buddhism and ending with a mixture of
Eastern and Western thought that could best be called theosophy. 

The  word  theosophy,  combining  roots  meaning  “God”  and  “wisdom,”  appeared  back  in  the  17th
century,  but  the  well-known  religious  movement  by  that  name,  under  the  leadership  of  the  Russian
Helena Blavatsky, appeared only around 1875. Blavatsky's theosophy combined elements of Plato's
philosophy with Christian, Buddhist, and Hindu thought (including reincarnation), in a way that she
claimed had been divinely revealed to her. The Theosophical Society, founded in 1875 to promote
her  beliefs,  still  exists,  as  does  the  Anthroposophical  Society,  founded  by  her  follower  Rudolf
Steiner.

- Words from Mythology and History

Achilles' heel 

 A vulnerable point. 

•  By  now  his  rival  for  the  Senate  seat  had  discovered  his  Achilles'  heel,  the  court  records  of  the
terrible divorce he had gone through ten years earlier. 

When the hero Achilles was an infant, his sea-nymph mother dipped him into the river Styx to make
him immortal. But since she held him by one heel, this spot did not touch the water and so remained
mortal  and  vulnerable,  and  it  was  here  that  Achilles  was  eventually  mortally  wounded.  Today,  the
tendon  that  stretches  up  the  calf  from  the  heel  is  called  the  Achilles tendon.  But  the  term  Achilles'
heel  isn't  used  in  medicine;  instead,  it's  only  used  with  the  general  meaning  “weak  point”—for
instance, to refer to a section of a country's borders that aren't militarily protected, or to a Jeopardy
contestant's ignorance in the Sports category.

- [[arcadia]] 

 A region or setting of rural pleasure and peacefulness. 

• The Pocono Mountains of Pennsylvania are a vacationer's arcadia. 

Arcadia, a beautiful rural area in Greece, became the favorite setting for poems about ideal innocence
unaffected by the passions of the larger world, beginning with the works of the Roman poet Virgil.
There, shepherds play their pipes and sigh with longing for flirtatious nymphs; shepherdesses sing to
their flocks; and goat-footed nature gods play in the fields and woods. Today, city dwellers who hope
to retire to a country house often indulge in arcadian fantasies about what rural life will be like.

- Cassandra 

 A person who predicts misfortune or disaster. 

• They used to call him a Cassandra because he often expected the worst, but his predictions tended to
come true. 

Cassandra, the daughter of King Priam of Troy, was one of those beautiful young maidens with whom
Apollo fell in love. He gave her the gift of prophecy in return for the promise of her sexual favors, but
at the last minute she refused him. Though he could not take back his gift, he angrily pronounced that
no one would ever believe her predictions; so when she prophesied the fall of her city to the Greeks
and the death of its heroes, she was laughed at by the Trojans. A modern-day Cassandra goes around
predicting gloom and doom—and may turn out to be right some of the time.

- [[cyclopean]] 

 Huge or massive. 

• They're imagining a new medical center on a cyclopean scale—a vast ten-block campus with thirty
high-rise buildings. 

The Cyclopes of Greek mythology were huge, crude giants, each with a single eye in the middle of his
forehead. Odysseus and his men had a terrible encounter with a Cyclops, and escaped utter disaster
only by stabbing a burning stick into the monster's eye. The great stone walls at such ancient sites as
Troy  and  Mycenae  are  called  cyclopean  because  the  stones  are  so  massive  and  the  construction
(which  uses  no  cement)  is  so  expert  that  it  was  assumed  that  only  a  superhuman  race  such  as  the
Cyclopes could have achieved such a feat.

- [[draconian]] 

 Extremely severe or cruel. 

•  The  severe  punishments  carried  out  in  Saudi  Arabia,  including  flogging  for  drunkenness,  hand
amputation for robbery, and beheading for drug trafficking, strike most of the world as draconian. 

Draconian comes from the name of Draco, a leader of Athens in the 7th century B.C. who in 621 B.C.
produced  its  first  legal  code.  The  punishments  he  prescribed  were  extraordinarily  harsh;  almost
anyone who couldn't pay his debts became a slave, and even minor crimes were punishable by death.
So severe were these penalties that it was said that the code was written in blood. In the next century,
the wise leader Solon would revise all of Draco's code, retaining the death penalty only for the crime
of murder.

- [[myrmidon]] 

 A loyal follower, especially one who executes orders unquestioningly. 

•  To  an  American,  these  soldiers  were  like  myrmidons,  all  too  eager  to  do  the  Beloved  Leader's
bidding. 

In the Trojan War, the troops of the great hero Achilles were called Myrmidons. As bloodthirsty as
wolves, they were the fiercest fighters in all Greece. They were said to have come from the island of
Aegina, where, after the island's entire population had been killed by a plague, it was said to have
been repopulated by Zeus, by turning all the ants in a great anthill into men. Because of their insect
origin, the Myrmidons were blindly loyal to Achilles, so loyal that they would die without resisting if
ordered to. The Trojans would not be the last fighting force to believe that a terrifying opposing army
was made up of men who were not quite human.

- [[nemesis]] 

 A powerful, frightening opponent or rival who is usually victorious. 

• During the 1970s and '80s, Japanese carmakers became the nemesis of the U.S. auto industry. 

The Greek goddess Nemesis doled out rewards for noble acts and vengeance for evil ones, but it's
only her vengeance that anyone remembers. According to the Greeks, Nemesis did not always punish
an offender right away, but might wait as much as five generations to avenge a crime. Regardless, her
cause  was  always  just  and  her  eventual  victory  was  sure.  But  today  a  nemesis  doesn't  always
dispense justice; a powerful drug lord may be the nemesis of a Mexican police chief, for instance,
just as Ernst Stavro Blofeld was James Bond's nemesis in three of Ian Fleming's novels.

- Trojan horse 

 Someone or something that works from within to weaken or defeat. 

• Researchers are working on a kind of Trojan horse that will be welcomed into the diseased cells
and then destroy them from within. 

After  besieging  the  walls  of  Troy  for  ten  years,  the  Greeks  built  a  huge,  hollow  wooden  horse,
secretly filled it with armed warriors, and presented it to the Trojans as a gift for the goddess Athena,
and the Trojans took the horse inside the city's walls. That night, the armed Greeks swarmed out and
captured and burned the city. A Trojan horse is thus anything that looks innocent but, once accepted,
has  power  to  harm  or  destroy—for  example,  a  computer  program  that  seems  helpful  but  ends  up
corrupting or demolishing the computer's software.
