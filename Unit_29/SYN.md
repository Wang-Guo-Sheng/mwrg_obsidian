- SYN is a Greek and Latin prefix meaning “together” or “at the same time.” So “in sync” (short for “in
synchronization”)  means  “together  in  time.”  And  a  synonym  is  a  word  that  can  be  considered
together with another word since it has the same meaning.

- [[syntax]] 

 The way in which words are put together to form phrases, clauses, or sentences. 

• The president's critics complain about his odd and confusing syntax when he speaks in public. 

Syntax is basically about what word comes before and after another word; in other words, it's part of
the  larger  subject  of  grammar.  Syntax  is  often  an  issue  in  poetry,  and  it's  usually  discussed  in
connection with diction—that is, the poet's choice of words. So, for example, your English professor
might point out the syntactic difference between “Whose woods these are I think I know” and “I think
I  know  whose  woods  these  are”;  whereas  if  the  discussion  was  about  diction  instead,  the  question
might be about the choice of “woods” rather than “land,” or “think” rather than “bet.”

- [[synthesize]] 

 To make something by combining different things. 

•  From  all  the  proposals  put  in  front  of  us,  we  were  asked  to  synthesize  a  plan  that  could  get  the
support of the whole group. 

Synthesize  is  a  very  common  word  in  chemistry,  since  chemists  are  constantly  synthesizing  new
compounds—that is, synthetic compounds—including drugs and industrial chemicals. It's also often
used when talking about writing; nonfiction writers must often synthesize large amounts of material
from many sources to produce a book—which represents a synthesis of the important materials. An
electronic synthesizercreates new sounds (which may imitate the sounds of acoustic instruments) by
generating different basic tones and then manipulating and merging them together with others.

- [[synergy]] 
work together. 

 The increased effectiveness that results when two or more people or businesses

• With the first company's importance in print media and the second's success on the Web, everyone
was convinced that the merger would result in an awesome synergy. 

An  old  saying,  “The  whole  is  greater  than  the  sum  of  its  parts,”  expresses  the  basic  meaning  of
synergy. The word is sometimes used in a purely physical sense, especially when talking about drugs;
sometimes a “cocktail” of drugs may be more effective than the sum of the effectiveness of each of the
separate drugs. But the word is best known in the world of business. The notion that, when the right
two  companies  merge,  they'll  produce  a  profitable  synergy  seemed  exciting  in  the  1990s,  when
synergy became a trendy buzzword (even though it's actually been around since the 17th century). The
idea  of  synergy  was  one  factor  in  what  became  a  “merger  mania”;  unfortunately,  business  synergy
often turned out to be harder to achieve than to imagine.

- [[syndrome]] 
particular abnormality or condition. 

  A  group  of  signs  and  symptoms  that  occur  together  and  characterize  a

• When there is no trembling—the most obvious symptom of Parkinson's disease—most doctors fail
to recognize the Parkinson's syndrome. 

Combining its two Greek roots, syndrome means basically “running together.” So when diagnosing a
condition or disease, doctors tend to look for a group of symptoms existing together. As long as a set
of  symptoms  remains  mysterious,  it  may  be  referred  to  as  a  specific  syndrome.  But  if  that  name  is
used for a while, it may become the condition's permanent name, even after an underlying cause has
been found. So today we have Down syndrome, acquired immune deficiency syndrome, Asperger's
syndrome,  carpal  tunnel  syndrome,  chronic  fatigue  syndrome,  Tourette's  syndrome,  sick  building
syndrome,  and  many  more.  And  since  mental  conditions  often  turn  out  to  have  physical  causes,
syndrome is used in psychology as well as in medicine.

- Words from Mythology and History

Adonis 

 A very handsome young man. 

• Conversation in the little clusters of girls suddenly stops whenever this Adonis—blond, muscular,
with an athlete's gait—swaggers down the school corridor. 

Adonis, like Narcissus (see narcissism), was a beautiful youth in Greek mythology. He was loved by
both  Aphrodite,  goddess  of  love  and  beauty,  and  Persephone,  goddess  of  the  underworld.  One  day
while  hunting,  he  was  killed  by  a  wild  boar.  In  answer  to  Aphrodite's  pleas,  Zeus  allowed  him  to
spend half the year with her and half in the underworld. Today a man called an Adonis probably has
strikingly fine features, low body fat, rippling muscles—and a certain vain attitude of overconfidence.
Adonises should beware; the boar that killed Adonis was sent by either the jealous Artemis (goddess
of hunting) or the envious Ares (god of war).

- [[amazon]] 

 A tall, strong, often masculine woman. 

• I was greeted by the team's captain, a robust, broad-shouldered amazon who gripped my hand with
crushing force. 

In  Greek  mythology,  an  Amazon  was  a  member  of  a  race  of  women  warriors.  One  of  the  famous
labors of Heracles (Hercules) was to obtain the sash of the Amazon queen Hippolyta, and the hero
Theseus  married  Hippolyta's  sister.  The  Amazon  River  got  its  name  when,  in  1542,  the  first
Europeans  to  descend  the  river  were  attacked  by  Indian  warriors  who,  even  at  close  range,  they
believed to be women. The mystery of these warriors continues to this day. However impressive a
figure they cut, though, not every tall and strong woman today would take it as a compliment to be
called an amazon.

- [[chimera]] 

 An often grotesque creature of the imagination. 

•  This  latest  piece  of  legislation  is  a  weird  chimera,  with  sections  devoted  to  agriculture,  defense,
welfare, law enforcement, and scientific research. 

In Greek mythology, the Chimera was a fire-breathing she-monster with a lion's head, a goat's body,
and a dragon's tail, which laid waste the countryside in southwestern Turkey. It was finally killed by
the  hero  Bellerophon,  whose  flying  horse,  Pegasus,  enabled  him  to  attack  from  the  air.  Over  time,
chimera came to be used for any imaginary monster made up of strange and mismatched parts; today
it's  the  name  of  several  species  of  truly  bizarre-looking  fish.  But  more  commonly  a  chimera  is  a
fantasy, an illusion, a figment of the imagination, or a dream that will never come true.

- [[cornucopia]] 
and ears of grain. (2) An abundance of something desirable. 

 (1) A container shaped like a hollow horn full of fruits, vegetables,

• These books were a cornucopia of wonderful stories and poems, and as a child I spent countless
hours with them. 

The Latin term cornu copiae meant “horn of plenty,” and cornucopia and horn of plenty have both
been  used  in  English  since  the  16th  century.  Both  terms  refer  to  a  hollow  goat's  horn,  or  a  wicker
basket shaped like one, overflowing with produce from the harvest. The cornucopia has been used as
a decorative image to represent abundance since at least the 5th century B.C., when it represented a
gift  given  by  the  infant  god  Zeus  to  his  beloved  nurse:  a  broken  goat's  horn  that  would  always
magically  be  filled  with  whatever  she  wanted.  In  the  U.S.,  cornucopias  are  often  seen  on  altars,  in
store-window displays, and as table centerpieces, especially at harvesttime or Thanksgiving.

- Elysium 

 A place or condition of ideal happiness; paradise. 

• They had named their estate Elysium, and as we gazed out over its fountains, ponds, and sweeping
lawns we could see why. 

This word came into Latin from the Greek Elysion. In classical mythology, Elysium, or the Elysian
fields, was the home of the blessed after death, the final resting place of the souls of the heroic and
the pure. So it's easy to see how the word came to mean any place or state of bliss or delight. When
we  try  to  picture  heaven,  many  of  us  probably  see  a  lovely  park;  the  great  boulevard  of  Paris  was
named for the beautiful park that originally bordered it: the Champs-Elysées, or Elysian Fields.

- [[epicure]] 

 A person with cultivated taste, especially for food and drink; a gourmet. 

• He reads trashy novels and watches junk on TV, but he has an epicure's love of fine cheeses and
wines. 

The Greek philosopher Epicurus was known for his original thinking about the nature of matter, but
he's  best  remembered  for  his  ideas  about  pleasure  as  the  chief  aim  of  life.  By  pleasure  Epicurus
chiefly meant the absence of pain and anxiety. However, over the years Epicureanism  has  come  to
mean  a  delight  in  fine  sensual  pleasures,  and  today  an  epicure  is  someone  with  refined  taste,
especially  in  food  and  wine.  To  display  your  own  refined  taste  in  language,  you  might  try  using
epicure and epicurean in place of the overused gourmet.

- [[exodus]] 

 A situation in which many people leave a place at the same time. 

• The war led to a mass exodus of Iraq's Christians. 

The second book of the Old Testament tells of the departure of Moses and the Israelites from Egypt
and their difficult journey across the Sinai Desert to Mount Sinai, from which they would eventually
complete their journey to their home in Palestine. The book's original Hebrew name was Shemot, but
it's known to English-speakers as Exodus, from the Greek exodos, “departure.” Leon Uris chose the
name Exodus for his powerful novel about the founding of Israel in the years after World War II, since
the  new  state's  postwar  settlers  had  departed  from  many  parts  of  the  world  for  their  new  home  in
Palestine.

- [[gorgon]] 

 An ugly, repulsive, or terrifying woman. 

• The beautiful star disappeared into the makeup room and emerged two hours later transformed into a
gorgon. 

The  Gorgons  were  three  monstrous  sisters  in  Greek  mythology,  the  most  famous  of  whom  was
Medusa. They had snakes for hair, and anyone who looked directly at them was immediately turned to
stone. Medusa herself was finally beheaded by the hero Perseus, who avoided looking straight at her
by instead watching her reflection in his mirrorlike shield. Today the familiar types of jellyfish, with
long snakelike tentacles descending from their headlike bodies, are known as medusas.
