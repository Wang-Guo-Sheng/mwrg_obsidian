- CIRCU/CIRCUM comes from the Latin circus, meaning “circle.” So a circus is traditionally held
under  a  round  tent.  A  circuit  can  be  a  tour  around  an  area  or  territory,  or  the  complete  path  of  an
electric current. To circumnavigate means “to navigate around”—often around the world.

- [[circuitous]] 
action. 

 (1) Having a circular or winding course. (2) Not forthright or direct in

• She sometimes arrives at her conclusions by circuitous reasoning that her students can't even follow.

Circuitous  is  usually  the  opposite  of  direct,  and  it's  generally  used  to  describe  either  roads  or
explanations.  Detours  are  usually  circuitous,  and  a  circuitous  path,  twisting  and  turning  and  cutting
back  on  itself,  is  the  kind  of  route  you'd  expect  to  find  in  the  mountains.  Lawyers  often  find
themselves  making  circuitous  arguments,  which  may  get  most  circuitous  when  they're  defending
particularly undesirable clients.

- [[circumference]] 
or surface of a shape or object. 

 (1) The perimeter or boundary of a circle. (2) The outer boundary

• To calculate the circumference of a circle, multiply its diameter by 3.1416. 

Attempts have been made to measure the circumference of the earth since the time of Aristotle. The
calculation that Columbus was relying on led him to think he could reach China by sailing west more
quickly than by sailing east. But that measurement had calculated the earth's circumference as about a
quarter too small, and the rest is history. Columbus wasn't the only one who got it wrong; many later
attempts continued to produce different measurements for the earth's circumference—even though the
Greeks had calculated it correctly way back in the 3rd century B.C.

- [[circumspect]] 
cautious. 

 Careful to consider all circumstances and possible consequences;

• Her answer was careful and circumspect, and I couldn't help thinking she knew a lot more than she
was telling. 

Since spect- [[comes]] from the Latin word for “look,” circumspect basically means “looking around”
yourself before you act. Being a doctor has traditionally called for a circumspect personality, which
gives  their  patients  confidence  in  them.  Scholars  are  known  for  their  circumspection,  since  there's
nothing worse for scholars' reputations than mistakes in the books or articles they've written. Bankers
once  had  a  reputation  for  great  circumspection,  but  the  financial  disaster  of  2008  earned  some
bankers a very different kind of reputation.

- [[circumvent]] 
by clever means. 

 (1) To make a circuit around. (2) To manage to get around, especially

• We knew there was a traffic jam on the highway and circumvented it by using back roads. 

In mythology, a person's attempts to circumvent fate are almost always doomed. In the Iliad we're told
of how Achilles' mother, Thetis, hoping to circumvent the prophecy that her child would die in a war
against  Troy,  disguised  the  boy  as  a  woman.  But  clever  Odysseus,  recruiting  for  the  Greek  army,
arrived disguised as a peddler, and among the jewels he displayed to the women of the household he
laid  a  sword.  The  young  Achilles,  ignoring  the  jewelry,  immediately  seized  the  sword,  thereby
identifying himself for what he was. Today we more often hear of attempts to circumvent the law, or
at least some requirements that we'd rather not have to deal with.

- MINI/MINU come from Latin words meaning “small” and “least.” So the minimum is the least, and a
