NECRO comes from the Greek nekros, meaning “dead body,” so it's not surprising that it shows up in
some  unappetizing  places.  A  necrophagous  insect,  for  instance,  is  one  that  feeds  on  dead  bodies;
when homicide investigators discover a corpse, they may use the insect evidence to figure out when
the person died.

- [[necrosis]] 

 Death of living tissue, usually within a limited area. 

•  He  had  ignored  the  spider  bite  for  several  days,  and  his  doctor  was  alarmed  to  see  that  serious
necrosis had set in. 

Cells die naturally after a period of time, but may also die as a result of injuries, infections, or cancer.
Burns produce necrosis, and the bedsores suffered by nursing-home patients are a form of necrosis.
The dreaded condition known as gangrene, in which the dying tissue turns black or green, is another
form. When untreated, the dying cells release substances that lead to the death of surrounding cells, so
untreated  necrosis  can  lead  to  death.  Treatment  usually  requires  the  removal  of  the  necrotic  tissue,
and in severe cases can even involve amputating a limb.

- [[necromancer]] 
reveal the future or influence the course of events. 

  One  who  conjures  the  spirits  of  the  dead  in  order  to  magically

•  Her  specialty  is  communication  with  the  dead,  and  she  might  once  have  been  known  as  a
necromancer, but her sign says simply “Psychic.” 

The  practice  of  necromancy  goes  back  as  far  as  the  ancient  Assyrians  and  Babylonians  and  has
continued through all the centuries since. In the Middle Ages it became associated with black magic;
condemned by the church, it had to be practiced secretly. In Europe a necromancer might work in a
remote graveyard at night, standing within a magical circle he had drawn to shield himself from the
anger of the spirits. The grave of a person who had died suddenly or violently might be plundered for
its  body  parts;  the  unused  energy  these  were  believed  to  contain  made  them  valuable  in  the
necromantic  ceremony.  But  body  parts  aren't  essential  to  necromancy,  which  is  now  practiced  by
channelers, mediums, and shamans, and even by groups of amateurs sitting around a Ouija board.

- [[necropolis]] 

 A cemetery, especially a large, elaborate cemetery of an ancient city. 

•  On  Sundays  the  downtown  is  like  a  necropolis,  and  he  was  always  slightly  disturbed  by  the
complete absence of life among all those buildings. 

With its -polis ending, meaning “city” (see POLIS/POLIT), a necropolis is a “city of the dead.” Most
of the famous necropolises of Egypt line the Nile River across from their cities. In ancient Greece and
Rome,  a  necropolis  would  often  line  the  road  leading  out  of  a  city;  in  the  1940s  a  great  Roman
necropolis  was  discovered  under  the  Vatican's  St.  Peter's  Basilica.  Some  more  recent  cemeteries
especially  deserve  the  name  necropolis  because  they  resemble  cities  of  aboveground  tombs,  a
necessity  in  low-lying  areas  such  as  New  Orleans  where  a  high  water  table  prevents  underground
burial.

- [[necropsy]] 

 An autopsy, especially one performed on an animal. 

• Daisy's sudden death was so mysterious that we paid for a necropsy, and it turned out she'd been a
victim of lethal chemicals in our imported dog food. 

Human  autopsies  are  generally  performed  either  to  determine  the  cause  of  death  or  to  observe  the
deadly  effects  of  a  disease  for  research  or  education  purposes.  Autopsies  may  be  necessary  when
tracking an epidemic; they're also performed to discover whether a death might actually have resulted
from  murder,  and  if  so,  what  evidence  it  might  reveal  that  could  help  catch  the  murderer.  Animal
necropsies are actually more common than human autopsies, since a farmer with livestock is always
concerned that whatever killed one animal not pose a threat to the others.

- PALEO  comes  from  the  Greek  palaios,  meaning  “ancient”—that  is,  “older  than  old.”  The  prefix
