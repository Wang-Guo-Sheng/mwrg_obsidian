- PALEO  comes  from  the  Greek  palaios,  meaning  “ancient”—that  is,  “older  than  old.”  The  prefix
sometimes  gets  attached  to  very  recognizable  words;  paleobiology,  for  instance,  deals  with  the
biology of fossil organisms, paleogeography is the study of geography in earlier geological eras, and
paleoecology is the study of the relationship of plants and animals to their environment in those eras.

- Paleolithic 
rough or chipped stone implements. 

 Of or relating to the earliest period of the Stone Age, characterized by

• He raves about the health benefits of his Paleolithic diet, the kind that our pre-agricultural, hunting-
and-gathering Stone Age ancestors would have eaten. 

Since lithos means “stone” in Greek, the name Paleolithic was given to the older part of the Stone
Age.  The  first  known  period  of  human  culture,  the  Paleolithic  actually  covers  almost  all  of  human
history, from the first use of stone tools around 2.5 million years ago until the invention of agriculture
around  10,000  years  ago.  For  almost  all  that  time,  humans  used  the  very  crudest  of  stone  tools,
produced by chipping away flakes of stone in order to make an edge for an ax or knife. Near the end
of  the  period,  animal  bones  and  antlers  were  being  used  for  tools,  especially  pointed  tools,  and
sculpted  figures  and  cave  art  were  being  produced.  The  Paleolithic  gave  way  to  the  Mesolithic
(“Middle Stone Age”) period, with its tools made of polished stone, wood, and bone.

- [[paleography]] 
writings. 

  (1)  The  study  of  ancient  writings  and  inscriptions.  (2)  Ancient

•  For  her  thesis  on  Central  American  paleography,  she  spent  a  winter  in  Honduras  studying  rock
inscriptions 30 miles upriver from the nearest town. 

The world's oldest literature dates from about 4,000 years ago, from the land known as Sumer (now
southern Iraq). Early writing took the form of pictographs, very simple pictures that first represented
things  or  ideas  and  later  came  to  represent  actual  words.  The  first  actual  alphabet,  in  which  each
character represents a sound, appeared in the same general region about 500 years later. But writing
developed  in  very  different  ways  in  different  parts  of  the  world,  and  1,000  years  later,  when
Europeans first arrived in the New World, alphabetic writing still wasn't being used anywhere in the
Americas.  Decoding  some  ancient  languages  has  proven  to  be  a  huge  task  for  paleographers,  and
determining the age and the source of a piece of writing can pose major challenges.

- [[paleontology]] 
known from fossil remains. 

  A  science  dealing  with  the  life  of  past  geological  periods  as

•  Her  obsession  with  dinosaurs  as  a  child  continued  through  her  teens,  and  no  one  was  surprised
when she started graduate school in paleontology. 

Until  the  1820s,  hardly  anyone  even  suspected  that  dinosaurs  had  ever  existed.  In  the  years  since,
paleontology has sought to discover the entire history of life on earth, from the era of single-celled
organisms up into the human era. Paleontologists continue to make remarkable discoveries, such as
that a huge meteorite that fell in the Gulf of Mexico wiped out the dinosaurs—all except the birds, the
only surviving dinosaurs. “Radiometric dating” can reveal the age (often tens of millions of years) of
a  rock  or  fossil  or  a  tiny  grain  of  pollen  by  measuring  how  much  its  radioactive  elements  have
disintegrated.  The  study  of  molecules  of  DNA,  RNA,  and  proteins  has  also  become  important  for
dating. Paleontologists often consult with geologists searching for oil, gas, and coal deposits, since
all these “fossil fuels” were formed from plant and animal remains.

- Paleozoic 
which vertebrates and land plants first appeared. 

  The  era  of  geological  history,  ending  about  248  million  years  ago,  in

•  His  geological  specialty  was  the  beginning  of  the  Paleozoic,  from  which  the  earliest  fish  fossils
date. 

The Greek root zo- [[means]] “animal,” so names such as Paleozoic were invented to refer to a period in
the development of animal life. For geologists, the Paleozoic era is followed by the Mesozoic (meso-
meaning  “middle”),  which  is  followed  by  the  Cenozoic  (cen-  meaning  “recent”).  Eras  are  huge
stretches  of  time;  geologists  break  eras  down  into  smaller  “periods”  and  “epochs.”  Thus,  the
Paleozoic ends with the Permian period, the Mesozoic ends with the Upper Cretaceous epoch, and the
Cenozoic  ends  with  the  Holocene  epoch—the  epoch  in  which  we  are  living.  The  Paleozoic  era
produced the first fish, the first land plants, the first insects, and the first amphibians and reptiles; the
dinosaurs, birds, and mammals had to wait for the Mesozoic.
