- INTER comes straight from Latin. In English it has various meanings; all of them can be expressed
broadly as “between,” but they're still quite distinct: “moving between” (intercity), “communicating
between” (intercom), “coming between” (intercept), and so on. No wonder so many English words
begin with inter-.

- [[intercede]] 
in behalf of another. 

 (1) To act as a go-between between unfriendly parties. (2) To beg or plead

•  He  had  interceded  for  her  with  their  boss  on  one  important  occasion,  for  which  she  was  still
grateful. 

The Latin cedere means “to go,” so “go between” is the most literal meaning of intercede. (The same
-cede root can also be seen in such words as precede and secede.) If you've been blamed unfairly for
something, a friend may intercede on your behalf with your coach or teacher. More often, it will be
the  coach  or  teacher  who  has  to  intercede  in  a  student  dispute.  The  intercession  of  foreign
governments  has  sometimes  prevented  conflicts  from  becoming  worse  than  they  otherwise  would
have.

- [[interstice]] 

 A little space between two things; chink, crevice. 

• All the interstices between the rocks have been filled with new cement, and the wall should be fine
for another hundred years. 

People  often  speak  of  interstices  in  the  physical  sense  (referring  to  the  interstices  in  surfaces,  for
example,  or  microscopic  interstices  between  particles  in  chemical  compounds),  but  also  often  in  a
less literal way (the interstices in a movie's plot, in the economy, in what's covered by a complicated
tax law, etc.). The pronunciation of interstice is slightly unusual; you might not guess that it's accented
on the second syllable. This is also true in the plural interstices, which is used more often than the
singular  form;  note  also  that  in  interstices the final e  is  usually  pronounced  long,  so  that  it  rhymes
with bees.

- [[interdict]] 
of supply) by firepower to stop or hamper an enemy. 

 (1) To prohibit or forbid. (2) To destroy, damage, or cut off (as an enemy line

•  All  weapons  trade  with  the  country  had  been  interdicted  by  the  NATO  alliance,  and  ships  were
actually being stopped and searched before being allowed to dock. 

Interdict and interdiction are used for very serious prohibitions—more serious than, say, a professor
telling the class that texting is forbidden during lectures. During the Middle Ages and Renaissance, an
interdict was a sentence imposed by the powerful Catholic Church forbidding a person or place, and
sometimes  even  an  entire  country,  from  receiving  church  privileges  or  participating  in  church
functions. Interdict now often means “cut off” in a physically forceful way as well; interdictions are
usually targeted at either arms supplies or illegal drug shipments.

- [[interpolate]] 
into a piece of writing or a conversation. 

 To put something between other things or parts, especially to put words

• On page 6, she noticed that someone had interpolated a couple of sentences that completely altered
the meaning of her original text. 

The  meaning  of  interpolate  is  often  entirely  innocent.  An  interpolation  in  a  text  may  have  been
approved by everyone concerned, and an interpolation in conversation is usually just an interruption.
But  in  its  older  meaning,  interpolating  usually  meant  tampering  with  a  text  secretly  to  change  its
apparent  meaning.  Legislators  are  sometimes  enraged  to  discover  what  someone  has  quietly
interpolated into their favorite bill at the last minute. And any contract always has to be read carefully
to make sure the other lawyer didn't slip in an undesirable interpolation.

- SUR is actually a shortening of the Latin prefix super-, meaning “over, above” (see SUPER), and has
