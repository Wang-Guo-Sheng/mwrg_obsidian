- MINI/MINU come from Latin words meaning “small” and “least.” So the minimum is the least, and a
minute amount is almost nothing. And mini- [[is]] all too familiar as a prefix that we've been applying to
all kinds of things since the 1950s: minivan, miniskirt, mini-mart, minipark, and the rest.

- [[minimalism]] 
characterized by extreme spareness and simplicity. 

  A  style  or  technique  (as  in  music,  literature,  or  design)  that  is

•  He'd  never  understood  what  anyone  liked  about  minimalism,  since  minimalist  stories  always
seemed to leave out any description of people's characters and motivation and rarely even described
their surroundings. 

In the 1960s, a few composers, including Philip Glass, Steve Reich, and John Adams, began writing
music inspired by the music of India and Southeast Asia, often with a quick pulsing beat and chords
that are repeated quickly over and over while small changes are slowly introduced. Minimalist art,
which began appearing around the same time, tries to strip away all personal elements, often leaving
only pure geometric forms; you may have seen the plain silver boxes of Donald Judd, or the straight
neon tubes of Bruce Nauman. In literature, the stripped-down fiction of Samuel Beckett and Raymond
Carver  is  often  considered  minimalist.  But  there's  a  real  question  whether  these  various  types  of
minimalism should even be considered the same concept.

- [[minuscule]] 

 Very small. 

• For someone who had been living on a minuscule budget since graduating from college, even the
paycheck for a minimum-wage job felt like wealth to her. 

As a noun, minuscule  means  a  style  of  ancient  or  medieval  handwriting  script  with  smaller  letters
than  earlier  scripts.  There  were  actually  several  minuscules,  but  the  most  important  was  promoted
from around A.D. 800 on by Charlemagne, who believed that any educated person in the Holy Roman
Empire should be able to read the Latin written by anyone else. If you've ever looked at a medieval
manuscript, you've probably seen minuscule script, along with so-called majuscule (for modern type,
we would use the words lowercase and capital instead); even today most of us can read medieval
minuscule and majuscule without too much trouble. Be careful about spelling minuscule; we tend to
expect a word meaning “small” to begin with mini- [[rather]] than minu-.

- [[minutiae]] 

 Very small or minor details. 

•  She  likes  “thinking  big,”  and  gets  annoyed  when  her  job  requires  her  to  deal  with  what  she
considers minutiae. 

As  you  might  guess,  this  word  comes  straight  from  Latin.  The  Romans  used  it  in  its  singular  form,
minutia, to mean “smallness,” and in the plural to mean “trifles”; today we almost always use it in the
plural  with  that  same  “trifles”  meaning.  Hardly  anyone  ever  talks  about  minutiae  except  to  dismiss
their  importance.  So  you  may  talk  about  the  minutiae  of  daily  life  or  the  minutiae  of  a  contract,  or
about getting bogged down or buried in minutiae at the office. Just don't forget that the devil is often in
the details.

- [[diminutive]] 

 (1) Indicating small size. (2) Very small. 

•  In  German,  Hänsel  is  a  diminutive  form  of  Hans  (which  is  a  diminutive  form  of  Johannes),  and
Gretel is a diminutive form of Margaret. 

Just  as  diminish  means  “to  grow  smaller,”  diminutive  means  “very  small.”  When  writing  about
language, diminutive as both an adjective and a noun refers to particular endings and the words made
with  them  to  indicate  smallness.  In  English,  such  endings  include  -et  and  -ette  (piglet,  dinette,
cigarette, diskette) as well as -ie and -y (doggy, bootie, Bobby, Debbie). However, diminutives are
more  common  in  many  other  languages.  Outside  of  language,  diminutive  is  used  for  many  things,
including  people  (“She  noticed  a  diminutive  figure  standing  shyly  by  the  door”),  but  often  not  very
seriously (“We were served some rather diminutive rolls”).
