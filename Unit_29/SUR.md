- SUR is actually a shortening of the Latin prefix super-, meaning “over, above” (see SUPER), and has
the same meaning. A surface is the face above or on the outside of something. A surplus is something
above and beyond what is needed. And to survey a landscape is to look out over it.

- [[surmount]] 

 To rise above; overcome. 

•  The  story  of  how  he  surmounted  poverty  and  crippling  physical  ailments  to  achieve  what  he
achieved is almost unbelievable. 

Our verb mount, meaning “ascend, get up onto,” comes from the same Latin root as mountain, and we
keep those images in mind when using surmount, since climbing up or over a mountain is a symbol of
achievement. The word almost always refers to human effort, and almost always in a positive way;
thus, we speak of surmounting difficulties, surmounting problems, surmounting hurdles, surmounting
handicaps—you get the idea.

- [[surcharge]] 

 An additional tax or charge. 

• Checking the bill, she discovered two surcharges that no one had warned her about. 

The Arab oil embargo of 1973 led airlines to add fuel surcharges to their passenger fares that were
large  enough  to  discourage  air  travel.  Surcharges  are  usually  added  for  special  service.  When  you
request  a  “rush  job”  from  a  service  supplier,  it  will  probably  bring  a  surcharge  along  with  it.  A
particularly  difficult  phone  installation  may  carry  a  surcharge.  An  extra-large  fine  for  a  speeding
offense after you've already had too many tickets could be called a surcharge. An added tax may be
called a surcharge (or surtax) when it only affects people with incomes above a certain level. And if
those low, low prices that show up in really big letters in ads for all kinds of services turn out to be
misleading,  it's  probably  because  they  don't  include  a  bunch  of  surcharges  that  you  won't  find  out
about till later.

- [[surfeit]] 

 A supply that is more than enough; excess. 

• Whenever he glanced into his daughter's room, he was always astonished at the utter surfeit of things
—dolls, dollhouses, stuffed animals, cushions, games, posters, and clothing strewn everywhere. 

Book and film critics often use surfeit when complaining about how an author or director has given
us  too  much  of  something.  In  our  consumer  society,  we're  always  noticing  a  surfeit  of  one  thing  or
another,  such  as  breakfast  cereals  in  the  supermarket.  Statistics  are  always  indicating  a  surfeit  of
lawyers or doctors or accountants in some parts of the country and a lack of them in others. The death
of a young star always results in a surfeit of articles and books about him or her. And a potluck supper
usually results in a surfeit of food, which might leave you surfeited, or stuffed.

- [[surreal]] 

 Very strange or unusual; having the quality of a dream. 

• In a surreal sequence, the main character gets a job on floor 7 1/2, which turns out to be only half as
high as the other floors, so everyone must walk around stooped over. 

In  1924  a  group  of  European  poets,  painters,  and  filmmakers  founded  a  movement  that  they  called
Surrealism. Their central idea was that the unconscious mind (a concept Sigmund Freud had recently
made famous) was the source of all imagination, and that art should try to express its contents. The
unconscious, they believed, revealed itself most clearly in dreams. The Surrealist painters included
René  Magritte,  Joan  Miró,  and  Salvador  Dalí,  whose  “limp  watches”  painting  became  the  best-
known  Surrealist  image  of  all.  Since  those  years,  we've  used  surreal  to  describe  all  kinds  of
situations  that  strike  us  as  dreamlike.  And  even  though  the  Surrealist  movement  ended  long  ago,
surrealism  now  seems  to  be  everywhere—not  just  in  painting,  literature,  and  movies  but  also  in
blogs, video games, and graphic novels.
