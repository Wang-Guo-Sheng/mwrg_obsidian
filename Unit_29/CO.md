- CO  is  a  Latin  prefix  that  generally  means  “with,  together,”  and  we  see  it  daily  in  such  words  as
costar,  cofounder,  co-owner,  and  coworker.  But  many  other  co-  words  aren't  quite  so  easy  to
understand when you first encounter them.

- [[coalesce]] 

 To come together to form one group or mass. 

•  Three  local  civic  groups  have  recently  coalesced  to  form  a  single  organization,  believing  it  will
result in more effective campaigns. 

Social movements are often said to coalesce when groups with somewhat different interests realize
how much they have in common. Some physicists believe that planets coalesced not from space rocks
but from icy clouds of cosmic dust. Some people even study how languages coalesce—for example,
the fairly new language Afrikaans, a mixture of Dutch and native languages spoken in South Africa,
which only really solidified about 150 years ago.

- [[cogeneration]] 
from an industrial process, or the use of steam from electric power generation as a source of heat. 

  The  production  of  electricity  using  waste  heat  (as  in  steam)

• With its new cogeneration system, the company reports converting over 65% of the energy in natural
gas to electricity, making this the most efficient power plant ever built. 

Cogeneration is basically the production of energy and usable heat (generally in the form of steam and
hot water) in the same plant, usually by capturing heat that in older plants used to be simply wasted.
It's one of the principal ways in which countries intend to reduce their greenhouse-gas emissions so
as to slow climate change. Cogeneration plants are often small, and the fuels used in them are varied.
Lumber mills, for instance, can operate their own cogeneration plants, feeding them with wood scraps
and sawdust, and wastewater treatment plants generate gas that can likewise be used as a source of
energy. Since it's hard to move heat long distances, cogeneration is most efficient when the heat can
be used nearby. Though the general public today knows little about cogeneration, more and more of us
will be benefiting from it in the coming years.

- [[codependency]] 
 A psychological condition or a relationship in which a person
is controlled or manipulated by someone affected with a condition such as alcohol or drug addiction. 

• She never knew what codependency was until her daughter took up with a mean, abusive alcoholic
and refused to leave him. 

Dependency on addictive substances has been known for centuries, but the concept of codependency
got its name only as recently as 1979. For many of us, codependency isn't easy to understand; we may
keep  asking  “Why  doesn't  she  just  leave  him?”  and  find  it  hard  to  accept  the  answers  we  get.
Codependents usually don't share their partners' addiction, but their lives tend to be taken over with
the  burden  of  caring  for  and  protecting  the  spouse  or  partner.  In  recent  years,  people  have  started
claiming  that  all  kinds  of  conditions—anorexia,  overeating,  gambling,  fear  of  intimacy,  etc.—can
result in codependency. Many experts think all of this has gone too far; still, almost everyone agrees
that spouses of alcoholics and drug addicts face unique difficulties and should look for support and
advice anywhere they can find it.

- [[cohesion]] 
which the particles of a body are united throughout the mass. 

  (1)  The  action  or  state  of  sticking  together.  (2)  Molecular  attraction  by

• The party's greatest strength was its cohesion and discipline, and on bill after bill that year not a
single member voted with the other party. 

Cohesion  is  one  of  the  noun  forms  of  cohere;  the  others  are  cohesiveness  and  coherence,  each  of
which  has  a  slightly  different  meaning.  Coherence  is  often  used  to  describe  a  person's  speech  or
writing. An incoherent talk or blog post is one that doesn't “hang together”; and if the police pick up
someone who they describe as incoherent, it means he or she isn't making sense. But to describe a
group or team that always sticks together, you would use cohesive, not coherent. And the words you'd
use  in  Chemistry  class  to  describe  the  way  molecules  hang  together—for  example,  the  way  water
forms into beads and drops—are cohesion, cohesive, and cohesiveness.

- SYN is a Greek and Latin prefix meaning “together” or “at the same time.” So “in sync” (short for “in
