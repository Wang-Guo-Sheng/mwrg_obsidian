精神治疗师（分析师和心理行为治疗师统称）

One who treats mental or emotional disorder or related bodily ills by psychological means. 

•  He's  getting  medication  from  a  psychiatrist,  but  it's  his  sessions  with  the  psychotherapist  that  he
really values. 

Many  psychologists  offer  psychological  counseling,  and  psychological  counseling  can  usually  be called psychotherapy, so many psychologists can be called psychotherapists. The most intense form of psychotherapy, called psychoanalysis, usually requires several visits a week. A competing type of therapy known as behavior therapy focuses on changing a person's behavior (often some individual habit such as stuttering口吃, tics抽搐, or phobias) without looking very deeply into his or her mental state.
