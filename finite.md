Having definite limits. 

• Her ambitions were infinite, but her wealth was finite. 

It  has  come  as  a  shock  to  many  of  us  to  realize  that  resources  such  as  oil—and  the atmosphere's ability  to  absorb  greenhouse  gases—are  finite  rather  than  unlimited.  The  debate  continues  as  to whether  the  universe  is  finite  or  infinite  and,  if  it's  finite,  how  to  think  about  what  lies  beyond  it.
Religion  has  always  concerned  itself  with  the  question  of  the  finite  (that  is,  human  life  on  earth) versus  the  infinite  (God,  eternity,  and  infinity).  But  finite  is  mostly  used  in  scientific  writing,  often with the meaning “definitely measurable.”
