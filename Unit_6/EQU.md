EQU comes from the Latin word aequus, meaning “equal.” To equalize means to make things equal.
Things that are equivalent  have  the  same  value,  use,  or  meaning.  All  three  sides  of  an  equilateral
triangle are of the same length. And an equation (for instance, 21 + 47 = 68) is a statement that two
mathematical expressions are equal.

- [[equable]] 

 (1) Tending to remain calm. (2) Free from harsh changes or extreme variation. 

•  Her  friends  thought  it  odd  that  such  an  equable  woman  had  married  a  man  so  moody  and
unpredictable. 

Equable usually describes either climate or personality. The word seems to be used less today than in
decades past, maybe because the personality type is less admired than it used to be. A steady, calm,
equable  personality  may  not  produce  much  excitement  but  usually  makes  for  a  good  worker  and  a
good parent, and maybe even a longer life. In the words of the poet Robert Service: “Avoid extremes:
be moderate / In saving and in spending. / An equable and easy gait / Will win an easy ending.”

- [[adequacy]] 

 Being equal to some need or requirement. 

• Environmentalists doubt the adequacy of these regulations to protect the wilderness areas. 

When  we  question  the  adequacy  of  health-care  coverage,  or  parking  facilities,  or  school  funding,
we're  asking  if  they  are  equal  to  our  need.  The  adjective  adequate  means  “enough”  or
“acceptable”—though in sentences like “His performance was adequate,” it really means “no better
than acceptable.”

- [[equilibrium]] 
stronger or greater than the other. (2) A state of emotional balance or calmness. 

 (1) A state in which opposing forces are balanced so that one is not

• The news had come as a shock, and it took him several minutes to recover his equilibrium. 

Equilibrium contains a root from the Latin libra, meaning “weight” or “balance.” As a constellation,
zodiac symbol, and astrological sign, Libra is usually pictured as a set of balance scales, often held
by the blindfolded goddess of justice, which symbolizes fairness, equality, and justice. Equilibrium
has special meanings in biology, chemistry, physics, and economics, but in all of them it refers to the
balance of competing influences.

- [[equinox]] 

 A day when day and night are the same length. 

• She and her friends got together for an equinox party twice a year to celebrate the arrival of the fall
and the spring. 

If you know that nox means “night” in Latin, it's not hard to remember the meaning of equinox. There
are  two  equinoxes  in  the  year:  the  spring  equinox,  around  March  21,  and  the  fall  equinox,  around
September  23.  The  equinoxes  are  contrasted  with  the  solstices,  when  the  sun  is  farthest  north  and
south  of  the  equator.  The  summer  solstice  occurs  around  June  22  (the  longest  day  of  the  year),  the
winter solstice around December 22 (the shortest day).

- QUIS is derived from the Latin verb meaning “to seek or obtain.” The roots quer, quir, and ques are
