- SON  is  the  Latin  root  meaning  “sound.”  Sonata,  meaning  a  piece  for  one  or  two  instruments,  was
originally  an  Italian  verb  meaning  “sounded”  (when  singers  were  involved,  the  Italians  used  a
different verb). And sonorous means full, loud, or rich in sound.

 (1) Having to do with sound. (2) Having to do with the speed of sound in air (about

•  A  sonic  depth  finder  can  easily  determine  the  depth  of  a  lake  by  bouncing  a  sound  signal  off  the
bottom. 

A  sonic  boom  is  an  explosive  sound  created  by  a  shock  wave  formed  at  the  nose  of  an  aircraft.  In
1947 a plane piloted by Chuck Yeager burst the “sound barrier” and created the first sonic boom. In
the  decades  afterward  sonic  booms  became  a  familiar  sound  to  Americans.  (Because  of  steps  that
were  eventually  taken,  sonic  booms  are  rarely  heard  anymore.)  Today  sonic  is  often  used  by
ambitious rock musicians to describe their experimental sounds.

- [[dissonant]] 
disagreeing. 

  (1)  Clashing  or  discordant,  especially  in  music.  (2)  Incompatible  or

• Critics of the health-care plan pointed to its two seemingly dissonant goals: cost containment, which
would try to control spending, and universal coverage, which could increase spending. 

Since  dissonant  includes  the  negative  prefix  dis-,  what  is  dissonant  sounds  or  feels  unresolved,
unharmonic, and clashing. Early in the 20th century, composers such as Arnold Schoenberg and his
students  developed  the  use  of  dissonance  in  music  as  a  style  in  itself.  But  to  many  listeners,  the
sounds  in  such  music  are  still  unbearable,  and  most  continue  to  prefer  music  based  on  traditional
tonality. Dissonant  is  now  often  used  without  referring  to  sound  at  all.  Cognitive  dissonance,  for
example, is what happens when you believe two different things that can't actually both be true.

- [[resonance]] 
depth and quality of sound. 

  (1)  A  continuing  or  echoing  of  sound.  (2)  A  richness  and  variety  in  the

• The resonance of James Earl Jones's vocal tones in such roles as Darth Vader made his voice one of
the most recognizable of its time. 

Many  of  the  finest  musical  instruments  possess  a  high  degree  of  resonance  which,  by  producing
additional vibrations and echoes of the original sound, enriches and amplifies it. Violins made by the
Italian  masters  Stradivari  and  Guarneri  possess  a  quality  of  resonance  that  later  violinmakers  have
never precisely duplicated. And you may have noticed how a particular note will start something in a
room  buzzing,  as  one  of  the  touching  surfaces  begins  to  resonate  with  the  note.  Because  of  that,
resonance and resonate—along with the adjective resonant—aren't always used to describe sound.
For  example,  you  may  say  that  a  novel  resonates  strongly  with  you  because  the  author  seems  to  be
describing your own experiences and feelings.

- [[ultrasonic]] 

 Having a frequency higher than what can be heard by the human ear. 

• My grandfather's dog is always pricking up its ears at some ultrasonic signal, while he himself is so
deaf he can't even hear a bird singing. 

Ultrasound, or ultrasonography, works on the principle that sound is reflected at different speeds by
tissues or substances of different densities. Ultrasound technology has been used medically since the
1940s.  Sonograms,  the  pictures  produced  by  ultrasound,  can  reveal  heart  defects,  tumors,  and
gallstones;  since  low-power  ultrasonic  waves  don't  present  any  risks  to  a  body,  they're  most  often
used to display fetuses during pregnancy in order to make sure they're healthy. Ultrasonics has many
other  uses,  including  underwater  sonar  sensing.  High-power  ultrasonics  are  so  intense  that  they're
actually used for drilling and welding.
