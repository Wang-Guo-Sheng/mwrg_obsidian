- METR/METER comes to us from Greek by way of Latin; in both languages it refers to “measure.” A
thermometer  measures  heat;  a  perimeter  is  the  measure  around  something;  and  things  that  are
isometric are equal in measure.

- [[metric]] 

 (1) Relating to or based on the metric system. (2) Relating to or arranged in meter. 

• Americans have resisted using the metric system for years, but are now slowly getting accustomed
to a few of the metric units. 

The metric system was invented in France in the years following the French Revolution, and a version
of it is now used in most of the world to measure distance, weight, and volume. Basic metric units
include the kilogram (the basic unit of weight), the liter (the basic unit of volume), and of course the
meter (the basic unit of length—see below). Metric—or more often metrical—can also refer to the
basic underlying rhythm of songs and poetry. So while the scientists' measurements are usually metric,
the poets' are usually metrical.

- [[meter]] 
rhythm in poetry or music. 

 (1) The basic metric unit of length, equal to about 39.37 inches. (2) A systematic

•  The  basic  meter  of  the  piece  was  3/4,  but  its  rhythms  were  so  complicated  that  the  3/4  was
sometimes hard to hear. 

Meter is a metric measurement slightly longer than a yard; thus, a 100-meter dash might take you a
second longer than a 100-yard dash. But the word has a different sense in music, where people aren't
separated by whether they use the metric system. For a musician, the meter is the regular background
rhythm, expressed by the “time signature” written at the beginning of a piece or section: 2/2, 2/4, 3/8,
4/4, 6/8, etc. Within a meter, you can create rhythms that range from the simple to the complex. So, for
example, “America the Beautiful” is in 4/4 meter (or “4/4 time”), but so are most of the rhythmically
complex songs written by Paul Simon, Burt Bacharach, or Stevie Wonder. In ordinary conversation,
though, most people use “rhythm” to include meter and everything that's built on top of it. In poetry,
meter has much the same meaning; however, poetic meters aren't named with numbers but instead with
traditional Greek and Latin terms such as iambic and dactylic.

- [[odometer]] 

 An instrument used to measure distance traveled. 

• Jennifer watched the odometer to see how far she would have to drive to her new job. 

Odometer  includes  the  root  from  the  Greek  word  hodos,  meaning  “road”  or  “trip.”  An  odometer
shares  space  on  your  dashboard  with  a  speedometer,  a  tachometer,  and  maybe  a  “tripmeter.”  The
odometer  is  what  crooked  car  salesmen  tamper  with  when  they  want  to  reduce  the  mileage  a  car
registers as having traveled. One of life's little pleasures is watching the odometer as all the numbers
change at the same time.

- [[tachometer]] 

 A device used to measure speed of rotation. 

• Even though one purpose of a tachometer is to help drivers keep their engine speeds down, some of
us occasionally try to see how high we can make the needle go. 

A tachometer is literally a “speed-measurer,” since the Greek root tach- [[means]] “speed.” This is clear
in the names of the tachyon, a particle of matter that travels faster than the speed of light (if it actually
exists,  it's  so  fast  that  it's  impossible  to  see  with  any  instrument),  and  tachycardia,  a  medical
condition in which the heart races uncontrollably. Since the speed that an auto tachometer measures is
speed of rotation of the crankshaft, the numbers it reports are revolutions per minute, or rpm's.
