- ERR, from the Latin verb errare, means “to wander” or “to stray.” The root is seen in the word error,
meaning a wandering or straying from what is correct or true. Erratum (plural, errata) is Latin for
“mistake”;  so  an  errata  page  is  a  book  page  that  lists  mistakes  found  too  late  to  correct  before  the
book's publication.

- [[errant]] 
away from an accepted pattern or standard. 

  (1)  Wandering  or  moving  about  aimlessly.  (2)  Straying  outside  proper  bounds,  or

• Modern-day cowboys have been known to use helicopters to spot errant calves. 

Errant means both “wandering” and “mistaken.” A knight-errant was a wandering knight who went
about  slaying  dragons  or  rescuing  damsels  in  distress  (at  least  when  he  was  on  good  behavior).
Arrant is a old-fashioned spelling of errant; an arrant knave (the phrase comes from Shakespeare) is
an  extremely  untrustworthy  individual.  An  errant  sock  might  be  one  that's  gotten  lost;  an  errant
politician might be one who's been caught cheating; and an errant cloud might be one that floats by all
alone in a deep-blue sky on a summer day.

- [[aberrant]] 

 Straying or differing from the right, normal, or natural type. 

• Sullivan's increasingly aberrant behavior was leading his friends to question his mental stability. 

Something aberrant has wandered away from the usual path or form. The word is generally used in a
negative  way;  aberrant  behavior,  for  example,  may  be  a  symptom  of  other  problems.  But  the
discovery of an aberrant variety of a species can be exciting news to a biologist, and identifying an
aberrant gene has led the way to new treatments for diseases.

- [[erratic]] 

 (1) Having no fixed course. (2) Lacking in consistency. 

• In the 1993 World Series, the Phillies weren't helped by the erratic performance of their ace relief
pitcher, “Wild Thing.” 

Erratic  can  refer  to  literal  “wandering.”  A  missile  that  loses  its  guidance  system  may  follow  an
erratic path, and a river with lots of twists and bends is said to have an erratic course. Erratic can
also mean “inconsistent” or “irregular.” So a stock market that often changes direction is said to be
acting erratically; an erratic heartbeat can be cause for concern; and if your car idles erratically it
may mean that something's wrong with the spark-plug wiring.

- [[erroneous]] 

 Mistaken, incorrect. 

• For years her parents had had an erroneous idea of her intelligence, because she didn't begin to talk
until the age of six. 

Erroneous  basically  means  “containing  errors,”  and,  since  most  of  us  are  constantly  suffering  from
mistaken notions, the word is often used in front of words such as “assumption” and “idea.” It's also
used  to  describe  the  kind  of  mistaken  information  that  can  lead  to  erroneous  theories,  erroneous
conclusions, and erroneous decisions.

- CED comes from the Latin verb cedere, meaning “to proceed” or “to yield.” Proceed itself employs
