- PLE/PLEN comes from a Latin word meaning “to fill.” It can be seen in the words plenty, meaning
basically “filled,” and complete, meaning “thoroughly filled.”

- [[plenary]] 

 (1) Including all who have a right to attend. (2) Complete in all ways. 

• For the convention's plenary session, five thousand members gathered to hear a star speaker. 

Plenary  often  shows  up  in  writing  referring  to  the  “plenary  power”  held  by  a  government,  and  is
particularly  used  for  powers  mentioned  in  a  constitution.  For  example,  under  the  U.S.  Constitution,
the Congress has plenary power to wage war, which means that no one else—not the courts, not the
states, not the president—has any power whatsoever to second-guess Congress about warmaking. But
in recent years, that hasn't stopped some presidents from starting conflicts that looked a lot like wars
to  most  people.  At  a  conference,  the  plenary  sessions  (unlike  the  various  smaller  “presentations,”
“workshops,” “forums,” and “seminars” that otherwise fill the day) try to bring everyone together in
the same room.

- [[complement]] 
make something complete. (2) A counterpart. 

  (1)  Something  that  fills  up  or  makes  perfect;  the  amount  needed  to

• On the committee, the two young people provided an energetic complement to the older members. 

A complement fills out or balances something. We think of salt as the complement of pepper (maybe
mostly  because  of  their  colors),  and  the  right  necktie  is  a  perfect  complement  to  a  good  suit.
Complement  can  also  mean  “the  full  quantity,  number,  or  amount”;  thus,  a  ship's  complement  of
officers  and  crew  is  the  whole  force  necessary  for  full  operation.  Complement  is  actually  most
common as a verb; we may say, for example, that a bright blue scarf complements a cream-colored
outfit beautifully. Don't confuse complement with compliment, which means an expression of respect
or affection.

- [[deplete]] 

 To reduce in amount by using up. 

• Years of farming on the same small plot of land had left the soil depleted of minerals. 

The de- [[prefix]] often means “do the opposite of,” so deplete means the opposite of “fill.” Thus, for
example,  a  kitchen's  food  supplies  can  be  rapidly  depleted  by  hungry  teenagers.  But  deplete  often
suggests something more serious. Desertions can deplete an army; layoffs can deplete an office staff;
and too much time in bed can rapidly deplete your muscular strength.

- [[replete]] 

 Fully or abundantly filled or supplied. 

•  The  professor's  autobiography  was  replete  with  scandalous  anecdotes  about  campus  life  in  the
1950s. 

Replete implies that something is filled almost to capacity. Autumn landscapes in New England are
replete  with  colorful  foliage.  Supermarket  tabloids  are  always  replete  with  details  of  stars'  lives,
whether real or imaginary. And a professor may complain that most of the papers she received were
replete with errors in grammar and punctuation.

- METR/METER comes to us from Greek by way of Latin; in both languages it refers to “measure.” A
