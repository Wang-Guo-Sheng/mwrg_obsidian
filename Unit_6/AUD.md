- AUD,  from  the  Latin  verb  audire,  is  the  root  that  has  to  do  with  hearing.  What  is  audible  can  be
heard. An audience is a group of listeners, sometimes seated in an auditorium. And audio today can
mean almost anything that has to do with sound.

- [[auditor]] 

 A person who formally examines and verifies financial accounts. 

• It seems impossible that so many banks could have gotten into so much trouble if their auditors had
been doing their jobs. 

The  auditing  of  a  company's  financial  records  by  independent  examiners  on  a  regular  basis  is
necessary to prevent “cooking the books,” and thus to keep the company honest. We don't normally
think of auditors as listening, since looking at and adding up numbers is their basic line of work, but
auditors do have to listen to people's explanations, and perhaps that's the historical link. Hearing is
more obviously part of another meaning of audit, the kind that college students do when they sit in on
a class without taking exams or receiving an official grade.

- [[auditory]] 
or organs of hearing. 

 (1) Perceived or experienced through hearing. (2) Of or relating to the sense

• With the “surround-sound” systems in most theaters, going to a movie is now an auditory experience
as much as a visual one. 

Auditory is close in meaning to acoustic and acoustical, but auditory usually refers more to hearing
than to sound. For instance, many dogs have great auditory (not acoustic) powers, and the auditory
nerve  lets  us  hear  by  connecting  the  inner  ear  to  the  brain.  Acoustic  and  acoustical  instead  refer
especially to instruments and the conditions under which sound can be heard; so architects concern
themselves  with  the  acoustic  properties  of  an  auditorium,  and  instrument  makers  with  those  of  a
clarinet or piano.

- [[audition]] 

 A trial performance to evaluate a performer's skills. 

•  Auditions  for  Broadway  shows  attract  so  many  hopeful  unknown  performers  that  everyone  in  the
business calls them “cattle calls.” 

Most  stars  are  discovered  at  auditions,  where  a  number  of  candidates  read  the  same  part  and  the
director chooses. Lana Turner famously skipped the audition process and was instead discovered by
an agent sipping a soda in a Sunset Boulevard café at age 16. Audition can also be a verb; so, for
example,  after  Miss  Turner  gained  her  stardom,  actors  had  to  audition  to  be  her  leading  man.  But
when musicians audition for a job in an orchestra, it's usually behind a screen so that the judges won't
even know their sex and therefore can't do anything but listen.

- [[inaudible]] 

 Not heard or capable of being heard. 

• The coach spoke to her in a low voice that was inaudible to the rest of the gymnastics team. 

With its negative prefix in-, inaudible means the opposite of audible. What's clearly audible to you
may be inaudible to your elderly grandfather. Modern spy technology can turn inaudible conversations
into audible ones with the use of high-powered directional microphones, so if you think you're being
spied on, make sure there's a lot of other noise around you. And if you don't want everyone around
you to know you're bored, keep your sighs inaudible.

- SON  is  the  Latin  root  meaning  “sound.”  Sonata,  meaning  a  piece  for  one  or  two  instruments,  was
