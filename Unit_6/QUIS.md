- QUIS is derived from the Latin verb meaning “to seek or obtain.” The roots quer, quir, and ques are
derived from the same Latin verb and give us words such as inquiry and question.

- [[inquisition]] 

 A questioning or examining that is often harsh or severe. 

• The President's first choice for the job turned him down, fearing the Senate hearings would turn into
an inquisition into her past. 

While an inquiry  can  be  almost  any  search  for  truth,  the  related  word  inquisition  suggests  a  long,
thorough investigation that involves extensive and harsh questioning. Though the two words originally
had  about  the  same  meaning,  today  inquisition  tends  to  remind  us  of  the  Spanish  Inquisition,  an
ongoing trial conducted by church-appointed inquisitors that began in the Middle Ages and sought out
nonbelievers, Jews, and Muslims, thousands of whom were sentenced to torture and to burning at the
stake.

- [[perquisite]] 
(2) Something claimed as an exclusive possession or right. 

 (1) A privilege or profit that is provided in addition to one's base salary.

•  A  new  car,  a  big  house,  and  yearly  trips  to  Europe  were  among  the  perquisites  that  made  the
presidency of Wyndam College such an attractive position. 

Though  the  Latin  source  of  perquisite  originally  meant  “something  insistently  asked  for,”  the  “ask”
meaning  has  mostly  vanished  from  the  English  word.  A  perquisite,  often  called  simply  a  perk,  is
instead something of value that the holder of a particular job or position is entitled to, usually without
even asking. The President of the United States, for instance, enjoys as perquisites the use of Camp
David and Air Force One. Perhaps because perquisites are usually available to only a small number
of  people,  the  word  sometimes  refers  to  non-job-related  privileges  that  are  claimed  as  exclusive
rights.

- [[acquisitive]] 

 Eager to acquire; greedy. 

• With each year the couple became more madly acquisitive, buying jewelry, a huge yacht, and two
country estates. 

Unlike  most  tribal  peoples  and  the  populations  of  some  older  countries,  we  Americans  live  in  an
acquisitive society, a society devoted to getting and spending. And America often makes successfully
acquisitive  people  into  heroes;  even  Ebenezer  Scrooge,  that  model  of  miserly  greed  and
acquisitiveness, was once defended by a White House chief of staff. An acquisitive nation may seek
to acquire other territories by force. But mental acquisition of specialized knowledge or skills—or
new vocabulary!—doesn't deprive others of the same information.

- [[requisition]] 
authority. 

  A  demand  or  request  (such  as  for  supplies)  made  with  proper

•  The  teachers  had  grown  impatient  with  having  to  submit  a  requisition  for  even  routine  classroom
supplies. 

Requisition  was  originally  a  noun  but  is  now  probably  more  common  as  a  verb.  So  we  either  can
speak of sending our office's purchasing department a requisition for computers, or of requisitioning
more  computers  from  the  department.  The  word  has  an  official  sound  to  it.  However,  one  of
Hollywood's  bittersweet  love  stories  begins  when  Omar  Sharif,  playing  a  World  War  II  freedom
fighter, says to Ingrid Bergman, who is the owner of a stately old yellow Rolls Royce, “I've come to
requisition your car.”
