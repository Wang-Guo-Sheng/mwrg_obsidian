- CED comes from the Latin verb cedere, meaning “to proceed” or “to yield.” Proceed itself employs
the root, as does recede, and their related nouns procession and recession employ another form of the
Latin verb.

- [[cede]] 

 To give up, especially by treaty; yield. 

• Their 88-year-old father reluctantly ceded control over his finances to two of the children this year. 

Cede is often a formal term used in discussing territory and rights, but is also used less formally. So,
for example, Spain ceded Puerto Rico to the U.S. in 1898, following the Spanish-American War, and
the  U.S.  ceded  control  of  the  Panama  Canal  to  Panama  in  1999.  Critics  warn  that  we  are  ceding
leadership in alternative-energy technology to China. Citizens of one European country or another are
always worrying that their own country is ceding too much power to the European Union. A tennis
player doesn't have any choice when she cedes her no. 1 ranking to a rival.

- [[concede]] 

 To admit grudgingly; yield. 

•  To  his  friends,  Senator  Beasley  concedes  that  his  reelection  campaign  was  badly  run  and  that  he
made several damaging errors. 

After  the  votes  have  been  counted,  one  candidate  traditionally  concedes  the  election  to  his  or  her
opponent by giving a concession speech. If you're lucky, your boss will concede that she was wrong
the last time she criticized you. But in the middle of an argument, we're not all so good at conceding
that the other guy might have a good point.

- [[accede]] 

 (1) To give in to a request or demand. (2) To give approval or consent. 

• This time Congress refused to accede to the demands of the president, and began cutting the funding
for the war. 

To  accede  usually  means  to  yield,  often  under  pressure  and  with  some  reluctance,  to  the  needs  or
requests of others. Voters usually accede to a tax increase only when they're convinced it's the only
real  solution  to  a  shortfall  in  government  funding.  A  patient  may  accede  to  surgery  only  after  the
doctor assures him it's better than the alternatives. If you accede to your spouse's plea to watch the
new reality show at 9:00, you may get to choose something better at 10:00.

- [[precedent]] 
of a similar kind. 

 Something done or said that may be an example or rule to guide later acts

•  When  Judy  bought  Christmas  presents  for  all  her  relatives  one  year,  she  claimed  that  it  set  no
precedent, but it did. 

A precedent is something that precedes, or comes before. The Supreme Court relies on precedents—
that is, earlier laws or decisions that provide some example or rule to guide them in the case they're
actually deciding. When hostages are being held for ransom, a government may worry about setting a
bad precedent if it gives in. And a company might “break with precedent” by naming a foreigner as its
president for the first time.

- Words from Mythology and History

Augean stable 
corruption. 

  A  condition  or  place  marked  by  great  accumulation  of  filth  or

• Leaders of many of the newly formed nations of Eastern Europe found that the old governments of
their countries had become Augean stables that they must now clean out. 

Augeus, the mythical king of Elis, kept great stables that held 3,000 oxen and had not been cleaned for
thirty years when Hercules was assigned the job as one of his famous “twelve labors.” This task was
enormous even for someone so mighty, so Hercules shifted the course of two rivers to make them pour
through  the  stables.  Augean  by  itself  has  come  to  mean  “extremely  difficult  or  distasteful”,  and  to
“clean  the  Augean  stable”  usually  means  either  to  clear  away  corruption  or  to  perform  a  large  and
unpleasant  task  that  has  long  called  for  attention.  So  today  we  refer  to  “Augean  tasks,”  “Augean
labor,”  or  even  “Augean  clutter.”  And  the  British  firm  Augean  PLC  is—what  else?—a  waste-
management company.

- Croesus 

 A very rich person. 

• Warren Buffett's extraordinary record of acquiring and investing made him an American Croesus. 

Croesus, which tends to appear in the phrase “rich as Croesus,” was the name of a king of Lydia, an
ancient kingdom in what is now western Turkey, who died around 546 B.C. Lydia was probably the
first  country  in  history  to  use  coins,  and  under  the  wealthy  and  powerful  Croesus  the  first  coins  of
pure silver and gold were produced, which may have added to the legends surrounding his wealth.
But it was Croesus who the Greek lawgiver Solon was thinking about when he said “Count no man
happy until his death”—and indeed Croesus was finally overthrown and may even have been burned
alive.

- [[dragon]]'s teeth 

 Seeds of conflict. 

• Many experts believed that, in invading a Middle Eastern country that hadn't attacked us, we were
sowing dragon's teeth. 

The  Phoenician  prince  Cadmus  once  killed  a  dragon,  and  was  instructed  by  the  goddess  Athena  to
plant  its  teeth  in  the  ground.  From  the  many  teeth,  there  immediately  sprang  up  an  army  of  fierce
armed  men.  The  goddess  then  directed  him  to  throw  a  precious  stone  into  their  midst,  and  they
proceeded  to  slaughter  each  other  until  only  the  five  greatest  warriors  were  left;  these  became
Cadmus's generals, with whom he constructed the great city-state of Thebes. When we “sow dragon's
teeth,” we're creating the conditions for future trouble.

- Hades 

 The underground home of the dead in Greek mythology. 

• In a dramatic scene, he crawls up out of the ground coated in black petroleum as though emerging
from Hades. 

In Greek mythology, Hades is both the land of the dead and the god who rules there. Hades the god
(who the Greeks also called Pluto) is the brother of Zeus and Poseidon, who rule the skies and the
seas. The realm called Hades, where he rules with his wife Persephone, is the region under the earth,
full of mineral wealth and fertility and home to dead souls. Hades today is sometimes used as a polite
term for Hell (“It's hotter than Hades in here!”).

- [[lethargic]] 

 (1) Lazily sluggish. (2) Indifferent or apathetic. 

• Once again the long Sunday dinner had left most of the family feeling stuffed and lethargic. 

The philosopher Plato wrote that before a dead person could leave the underworld to begin a new
life,  he  or  she  had  to  drink  from  the  river  Lethe,  whose  name  means  “forgetfulness”  in  Greek,  and
forget all aspects of one's former life and the time spent in Hades (usually pretty awful, according to
Plato). But lethargic and its noun lethargy never actually refer to forgetting; instead, they describe the
weak, ghostly state of the dead spirits—so weak that they may require a drink of blood before they
can even speak.

- Midas touch 

 The talent for making money in every venture. 

• Investors are always looking for an investment adviser with the Midas touch, but after a couple of
good years each adviser's brilliance usually seems to vanish. 

Midas was a legendary king of Phrygia (in modern-day Turkey). In return for a good deed, he was
granted  one  wish  by  the  god  Dionysus,  and  asked  for  the  power  to  turn  everything  he  touched  into
gold. When he discovered to his horror that his touch had turned his food and drink—and even his
daughter—to  gold,  he  begged  Dionysus  to  take  back  the  gift,  and  Dionysus  agreed  to  do  so.  When
“Midas touch” is used today, the moral of this tale of greed is usually ignored.

- Pyrrhic victory 

 A victory won at excessive cost. 

•  That  win  turned  out  to  be  a  Pyrrhic  victory,  since  our  best  players  sustained  injuries  that  would
sideline them for weeks. 

In 279 B.C. Pyrrhus, the king of Epirus, a country in northwest Greece, defeated the Romans at the
Battle of Ausculum, but lost all of his best officers and many men. He is said to have exclaimed after
the battle, “One more such victory and we are lost.” Pyrrhic victories are more common than we tend
to think. Whenever we win an argument but in so doing manage to offend the friend we were arguing
with, or whenever a country invades another country but rouses widespread opposition in surrounding
countries in the process, it's probably a Pyrrhic victory that has been achieved.

- [[stygian]] 

 Extremely dark, dank, gloomy, and forbidding. 

• When the power went out in the building, the halls and stairwells were plunged in stygian darkness. 

The Greek underworld of Hades was cold and dark, rather than blazing like the Christian image of
Hell. The river Styx, whose name meant “hateful” in Greek, was the chief river of the underground,
and the souls of the dead were ferried across its poisonous waters into Hades by the boatman Charon.
The Styx was so terrible that even the gods swore by its name in their most solemn oaths. The name
Stygia, borrowed from stygian, is used for a country in fantasy games today; but a stygian atmosphere,
a  stygian  tunnel,  stygian  darkness,  and  so  on,  still  describe  the  dreary  cheerlessness  of  the  Greek
underworld.
