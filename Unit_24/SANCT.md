- SANCT,  meaning  “holy,”  comes  from  the  Latin  word  sanctus. Thus, sanctity  means  “holiness.”  In
ancient Greece, a spot could be sanctified, or “made holy,” by a group of priests who carried out a
solemn ritual; these might be spots where fumes arose from a crack in the earth or where a spring of
clear water flowed out of the ground, and a temple might be built there for worship of a god.

- [[sanction]] 

 To give approval to. 

• The bill's opponents claimed that removing criminal penalties for drug possession would amount to
sanctioning drug use. 

Sanction  originally  meant  “make  holy”  or  “give  official  church  approval  to.”  The  word  still  has  a
solemn sound to it, so sanctioning is something generally done by an institution or government, though
not necessarily by a church. So a college may sanction—or “give its blessing to”—the use of office
space by a gay organization, or a hot-rod association may sanction two new tracks for official races.
But sanction is also a noun, which may have two near-opposite meanings, “approval” and “penalty.”
Thus, a company may be accused of giving its sanction to illegal activities. But when two or more
countries impose sanctions on another country, it often involves cutting off trade. No wonder sanction
is such a tricky word for so many of us.

- [[sanctimonious]] 
than other people. 

 Pretending to be more religiously observant or morally better

• The candidates' speeches were sanctimonious from beginning to end, filled with stories about how
their deep faith was the basis for everything they did. 

Making a show of your religious morality has always struck some people the wrong way, including
Jesus. In his Sermon on the Mount, Jesus preaches that, when we give away money for charity, we
shouldn't let our left hand know what our right hand is doing—that is, the giving should be done for its
own sake and other people shouldn't be told about it. Those who make a display of how good and
pious  they  are  called  hypocrites.  But  sanctimony,  or  sanctimoniousness,  has  often  been  a  good
strategy for American politicians, many of whom have found it a great way to win votes.

- [[sacrosanct]] 
from criticism or disturbance of any kind. 

 (1) Most sacred or holy. (2) Treated as if holy and therefore immune

• Lots of experts have criticized the governor's education program, but it's regarded as sacrosanct by
members of her own party. 

Sacrosanct  means  literally  “made  holy  by  a  sacred  rite,”  and  in  its  original  use  the  word  was
reserved  for  things  of  the  utmost  holiness.  But  sacrosanct  is  now  used  to  describe  a  questionable
sacredness which nevertheless makes something immune from attack or violation; that is, the person
using  the  word  usually  doesn't  regard  the  thing  as  sacred  at  all.  So  to  call  a  government  program
sacrosanct is to imply that others regard it as untouchable. And a piece of writing is more likely to be
thought of as sacrosanct by its author than by the editor who has to fix it up.

- [[sanctuary]] 
one. (2) A place of safety, refuge, and protection. 

 (1) A holy place, such as a church or temple, or the most holy part of

• The midtown park is a tranquil sanctuary amidst the city's heat, noise, and bustle. 

Historically, churches have been places where fugitives could seek at least temporary protection from
the law. In Anglo-Saxon England, churches and churchyards generally provided 40 days of immunity,
and  neither  the  sheriffs  nor  the  army  would  enter  to  seize  the  outlaw.  But  gradually  the  right  of
sanctuary was eroded. In 1486 sanctuary for the crime of treason was disallowed, and sanctuary for
most other crimes was severely restricted by Henry VIII and later abolished. In the 1980s many U.S.
churches  provided  sanctuary  to  political  refugees  from  Central  America,  and  the  U.S.  government
mostly chose not to interfere. Today, wildlife sanctuaries provide protection for the species within its
boundaries, and farm-animal sanctuaries now rescue livestock from abuse and starvation.
