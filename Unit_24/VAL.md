- VAL has as its basic meaning “strength,” from the Latin verb valere, meaning “to be worthy, healthy,
or  strong”  and  “to  have  power  or  influence.”  So  evaluating  a  house  involves  determining  how
healthy it is. A valid license or credit card is one that's still in effect, and a valid proof is one that
provides strong evidence.

- [[valor]] 

 Personal bravery in the face of danger. 

• The gun duels of the Old West were invented by a novelist inspired by the valor of the knights in
medieval tournaments. 

Valor in uniform is still rewarded by medals. Many American civic organizations award a Medal of
Valor for physical courage, and the Air Force Medal of Honor displays the single word “Valor.” The
somewhat old-fashioned adjective valorous more often describes warriors of the past. But valiant is
still  in  common  use,  though  it  less  often  describes  military  courage  than  other  kinds  of  bravery  or
effort.

- [[equivalent]] 
virtually identical in effect or function. 

  (1)  Equal  in  force,  amount,  value,  area,  or  volume.  (2)  Similar  or

• A square can be equivalent to a triangle in area, but not in shape. 

Modern democracies have institutions and offices that are roughly equivalent to those found in others:
the president of the United States has his British equivalent in the prime minister, for instance, and the
U.S. Congress finds its equivalent in the British Parliament. The heavily armored knight on his great
armored  horse  has  been  called  the  Middle  Ages'  equivalent  of  the  army  tank.  In  none  of  these
examples  are  the  two  things  identical  to  each  other;  they're  simply  very  similar  in  their  effect  or
purpose or nature, which is what equivalence usually implies.

- [[prevalent]] 

 Widely accepted, favored, or practiced; widespread. 

• On some campuses Frisbees seem to be more prevalent than schoolbooks, especially in the spring. 

Many  diseases  that  were  prevalent  a  century  ago  have  been  controlled  by  advances  in  medicine.
Smallpox  was  prevalent  on  several  continents  for  many  centuries,  and  when  Europeans  brought  it
with them to the Americas, it killed more American Indians than the armed settlers did. But prevalent
doesn't just describe diseases. One ideal of male or female beauty may be prevalent in a particular
society and quite a different ideal in another. In the 1950s and '60s, there was a prevalent notion that
if you went swimming less than an hour after eating you might drown because of stomach cramps—
which goes to show that not every prevalent idea is exactly true.

- [[validate]] 
the validity of. 

 (1) To make legally valid; give official approval to. (2) To support or confirm

• It will take many more research studies to validate a theory as far-reaching as this one. 

Validating  a  pass  might  require  getting  an  official  stamp  on  it.  Validating  experimental  data  might
require  checking  it  against  data  from  further  experiments.  An  A  on  a  test  might  validate  your  study
methods. And you might go to a trusted friend to validate your decision to get rid of your boyfriend,
buy a pet iguana, or sell everything and move to Las Vegas.
