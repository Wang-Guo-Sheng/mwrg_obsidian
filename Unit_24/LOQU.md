- LOQU comes from the Latin verb loqui, “to talk.” An eloquent preacher speaks fluently, forcefully,
and expressively. And a dummy's words come out of a ventriloquist's mouth—or perhaps out of his
belly (in Latin, venter).

- [[colloquium]] 
subject and then answering questions about it. 

  A  conference  in  which  various  speakers  take  turns  lecturing  on  a

•  There's  a  colloquium  at  Yale  on  Noah  Webster  in  September,  where  she's  scheduled  to  deliver  a
paper. 

A  colloquy  is  a  conversation,  and  especially  an  important,  high-level  discussion.  Colloquy  and
colloquium  once  meant  the  same  thing,  though  today  colloquium  always  refers  to  a  conference.
Because  of  its  old  “conversation”  meaning,  however,  a  colloquium  is  a  type  of  conference  with
important question-and-answer periods.

- [[soliloquy]] 

 A dramatic speech that represents a series of unspoken thoughts. 

•  Film  characters  never  have  onscreen  soliloquies,  though  they  may  tell  us  their  thoughts  in  a
voiceover. 

Since  solus  means  “alone”  in  Latin,  soliloquies  take  place  when  a  character  is  alone  onstage,  or
maybe spotlighted off to one side of a dark stage. Novels have no trouble in expressing to the reader a
character's personal thoughts, but such expression is less natural to stage drama. The soliloquies of
Shakespeare—in  Hamlet  (“To  be  or  not  to  be”),  Macbeth  (“Tomorrow  and  tomorrow  and
tomorrow”), Romeo  and  Juliet  (“But  soft!  what  light  from  yonder  window  breaks”),  etc.—are  the
most famous, but modern playwrights such as Tennessee Williams, Arthur Miller, and Sam Shepard
have also employed them.

- [[colloquial]] 

 Conversational in style. 

• The author, though obviously a professional writer, uses a colloquial style in this new book. 

Since colloquy means basically “conversation,” colloquial language is the language almost all of us
speak. It uses contractions (“can't,” “it's,” “they've”), possibly some slang, lots of short words and not
many  long  ones.  But  our  language  usually  changes  when  we  write,  becoming  more  formal  and
sometimes  even  “literary.”  Except  in  e-mails  and  text  messages,  many  people  never  write  a
contraction or use the word “I”, and avoid informal words completely. But colloquial language isn't
necessarily bad in writing, and it's sometimes more appropriate than the alternative.

- [[loquacious]] 

 Apt to talk too much; talkative. 

•  She  had  hoped  to  read  quietly  on  the  plane,  but  the  loquacious  salesman  in  the  next  seat  made  it
nearly impossible. 

A loquacious speaker can leave a big audience stifling its yawns after the first 45 minutes, and the
loquaciousness  of  a  dinner  guest  can  keep  everyone  else  from  getting  a  word  in  edgewise.
Loquacious  letters  used  to  go  on  for  pages,  and  a  loquacious  author  might  produce  a  1,200-page
novel.  Lincoln's  brief  269-word  Gettysburg  Address  was  delivered  after  a  two-hour,  13,000-word
speech by America's most famous orator, a windbag of loquacity.
