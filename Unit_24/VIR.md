- VIR  is  Latin  for  “man.”  A  virtue  is  a  good  quality—originally,  the  kind  of  quality  an  ideal  man
possessed. And virtuous behavior is morally excellent. All in all, the Romans seem to have believed
that being a man was a good thing.

- [[virility]] 

 Energetic, vigorous manhood; masculinity. 

•  For  his  entire  life  he  believed  that  anyone  who  had  been  a  Marine  had  established  his  virility
beyond any doubt. 

Luckily,  there's  no  doubt  about  what  virility  is,  since  it's  depicted  on  the  covers  of  dozens  of  new
romance novels every month! A masterful and dominating manner, a splendid bared chest, a full head
of  lustrous  hair,  and  an  array  of  stunning  costumes  seem  to  be  what's  required.  (Virile  traits  often
missing  in  these  men  are  hair  on  the  chest  and  any  hint  of  future  baldness.)  High-school  football
provides a showplace for demonstrations of adolescent virility, and for years afterward virile high-
school  players  can  keep  using  football  language  in  their  business  life:  “get  to  the  red  zone,”  “Hail
Mary pass,” “move the ball,” and on and on.

- [[triumvirate]] 
three. 

 (1) A commission or government of three. (2) A group or association of

• A triumvirate slowly emerged as the inner circle of the White House, and the vice president wasn't
among them. 

The first triumvirate of the Roman Republic, which consisted of Julius Caesar, Pompey, and Crassus,
was simply an alliance or partnership, not a formal institution of the government. The alliance didn't
last  long,  however,  and  Caesar  eventually  emerged  with  total  power.  This  led  to  his  assassination,
after  which  a  second  triumvirate  took  over,  with  Octavian,  Mark  Antony,  and  Lepidus  dividing  the
Roman world among themselves. But these triumvirs also soon turned on one another, with Octavian
alone taking power; in time he would become Rome's first emperor.

- [[virago]] 

 A loud, bad-tempered, overbearing woman. 

• The staff called her a virago and other things behind her back, but everyone was respectful of her
abilities. 

The original Latin meaning of virago was “female warrior.” But in later centuries the meaning shifted
toward  the  negative.  The  most  famous  virago  in  English  literature  is  the  ferocious  Kate  in
Shakespeare's  The  Taming  of  the  Shrew.  Some  historical  viragoes  have  also  become  famous.
Agrippina  poisoned  her  husband,  the  Emperor  Claudius,  so  that  her  son  Nero  could  take  his  place
(but it was Nero himself who eventually had her assassinated). And Queen Eleanor of Aquitaine, a
powerful virago of the 12th century, was imprisoned by her husband, King Henry II of England, after
she  encouraged  their  sons  to  rebel  against  him.  Today  some  people  are  beginning  to  use  virago
admiringly again.

- [[virtuosity]] 

 Great technical skill, especially in the practice of a fine art. 

•  Playing  with  the  band,  his  virtuosity  doesn't  show  through;  you  really  have  to  hear  him  solo  to
appreciate him. 

Virtuosity is used particularly to describe musicians, but also often for writers, actors, dancers, and
athletes. A virtuoso is a highly skilled performer, and a virtuoso performance is one that astonishes
the  audience  by  its  feats.  In  ancient  Greece  the  cities  would  hold  male  competitions  in  acrobatics,
conjuring, public reciting, blowing the trumpet, and acting out scenes from Homer's epics, the winners
of which would have been praised as virtuous, or “full of manly virtues.”

- VAL has as its basic meaning “strength,” from the Latin verb valere, meaning “to be worthy, healthy,
