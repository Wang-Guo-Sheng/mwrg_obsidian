MAND  comes  from  mandare,  Latin  for  “entrust”  or  “order.”  A  command  is  an  order;  a
commandment is also an order, but usually one that comes from God. And a commando unit carries
out orders for special military actions.

• The new president claimed his landslide victory was a mandate from the voters to end the war. 

A mandate from a leader is a command you can't refuse. But that kind of personal command is rarely
the meaning of mandate today; much more common are connected with institutions. Thus, the Clean
Air Act was a mandate from Congress to clean up air pollution—and since mandate is also a verb,
we could say instead that the Clear Air Act mandated new restrictions on air pollution. Elections are
often interpreted as mandates from the public for certain kinds of action. But since a politician is not
just  a  symbol  of  certain  policies  but  also  an  individual  who  might  happen  to  have  an  awfully  nice
smile, it can be risky to interpret most elections as mandating anything at all.

 Required. 

• If attendance at the meeting hadn't been mandatory, she would have just gone home. 

Something mandatory is the result of a mandate or order, which usually comes in the form of a law,
rule, or regulation. Today there seem to be a lot of these mandates, so mandatory seat belts, mandatory
inspections  for  industries,  and  mandatory  prison  sentences  for  violent  crimes  are  regularly  in  the
news. But mandatory retirement at age 65, which used to be common, is now illegal in most cases.

  To  take  possession  of  something  by  force,  especially  for  military

• No sooner had they started their meeting than the boss showed up and commandeered the conference
room. 

Military forces have always had the power to commandeer houses. The Declaration of Independence
complains  about  the  way  the  British  soldiers  have  done  it,  and  the  third  Amendment  to  the
Constitution states that the commandeering of people's houses shall be done only in a way prescribed
by law. Almost anything—food, supplies, livestock, etc.—can be militarily commandeered when the
need arises. But you don't have to be in the military for someone to “pull rank” on you: Your father
may commandeer the car just when you were about to take it out for the evening, your teacher may
commandeer  your  cell  phone  as  you're  texting  in  the  middle  of  class,  or  your  older  sister  may
commandeer the TV remote to watch some lousy dancing competition.

• The state supreme court had remanded the case to the superior court, instructing it to consider the
new evidence. 

Remand  means  “order  back”  or  “send  back.”  After  losing  a  case  in  a  lower  court,  lawyers  will
frequently appeal it to a higher court. If the higher court looks at the case and sees that the lower court
made certain kinds of errors, it will simply remand it, while telling the lower court how it fell short
the first time: by not instructing the jury thoroughly, for example, or by not taking into account a recent
related court decision.

- UND  comes  into  English  from  the  Latin  words  unda, “wave,” and undare,  “to  rise  in  waves,”  “to
