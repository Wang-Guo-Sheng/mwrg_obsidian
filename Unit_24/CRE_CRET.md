- CRE/CRET  comes  from  the  Latin  verb  crescere,  which  means  both  “to  come  into  being”  and  “to
grow.” So a crescendo in music occurs when the music is growing louder, and a decrescendo when
it's growing softer.

quarter and the next new moon. (2) Anything shaped like the crescent moon. 

  (1)  The  moon  between  the  new  moon  and  first  quarter,  and  between  the  last

•  The  symbol  of  Islam  is  a  crescent  moon  with  a  star  between  the  points,  an  astronomical
impossibility. 

Crescent means basically “growing,” since a crescent moon is in the process of “growing” to a full
moon. A crescent wrench,  with  its  open  end  (unlike  the  kind  of  wrench  that  has  an  almost  circular
end), can be found in almost any household. A croissant, or crescent pastry, is a breakfast staple. The
curving  region  called  the  Fertile  Crescent,  which  stretches  from  the  Persian  Gulf  up  through  Iraq,
across  to  Lebanon  and  Israel,  and  down  into  Egypt's  Nile  River  valley,  was  the  birthplace  of
civilization, where weaving, pottery, domesticated livestock, irrigation farming, and writing all first
appeared.

- [[accretion]] 
buildup. 

  (1)  Growth  or  enlargement  by  gradual  buildup.  (2)  A  product  of  such

• The house and barn were linked by an accretion of outbuildings, each joined to the next. 

The slow accretion of scientific knowledge over many centuries has turned into an avalanche in our
time.  Any  accretion  of  ice  on  a  grounded  jet  will  result  in  takeoff  delays  because  of  the  danger  it
poses. The land area of the Mississippi Delta increases every year from the accretion of soil washed
down  the  Mississippi  River,  though  the  accretions  happen  so  slowly  that  it's  difficult  to  detect  any
increase at all. Accretion is often used in scientific writing; its usual verb form, accrue, is more often
used in financial contexts (“This figure doesn't count the accrued interest on the investments”).

- [[excrescence]] 
disfiguring, unnecessary, or unwanted mark or part. 

  (1)  A  projection  of  growth,  especially  when  abnormal.  (2)  A

• The new warehouse squatted like some hideous excrescence on the landscape. 

Warts  and  pimples  are  common  excrescences  that  can  usually  be  wiped  out  with  medication;  other
excrescences  such  as  cysts  and  tumors  need  to  be  removed  surgically.  Mushrooms  are  the
excrescences  of  underground  fungus  networks.  Some  people  consider  slang  words  to  be  vulgar
excrescences on the English language, but others consider slang the most colorful vocabulary of all.

- [[increment]] 
 (1) Something gained or added, especially as one of a series of regular
additions or as a tiny increase in amount. (2) The amount or extent of change, especially the positive
or negative change in value of one or more variables. 

• Her bank account has grown weekly by increments of $50 for the past two years. 

Increment  is  used  in  many  technical  fields,  but  also  nontechnically.  Incremental  increases  in  drug
dosages  are  used  for  experimental  purposes.  Incremental  tax  increases  are  easier  to  swallow  than
sudden  large  increases.  Incremental  changes  of  any  kind  may  be  hard  to  notice,  but  can  be  very
significant in the long run. Rome wasn't built in a day, but was instead built up by increments from a
couple of villages in the 10th century B.C. to the capital of the Mediterranean world in the 1st century
A.D.
