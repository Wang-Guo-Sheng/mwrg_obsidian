- FUS comes from the Latin verb fundere, “to pour out” or “to melt.” A fuse depends on melting metal
to break an overloaded circuit. Nuclear fusion involves the “melting” together of light nuclei to form
heavier nuclei, and fusion cuisine brings together the cooking of two or more cultures.

- [[transfusion]] 
blood vessel. (2) Something transfused. 

  (1)  The  process  of  transferring  a  fluid  and  especially  blood  into  a

• The transfusion gave her an immediate burst of energy, and her friends were astonished when they
arrived at the hospital that afternoon. 

When blood transfusions were first attempted by Europeans in the early 1600s, they were met with
skepticism, since the established practice was to bleed patients, not transfuse them with blood. Some
patients were transfused with animal blood, and so many died as a result that by 1700 transfusions
had  been  widely  outlawed.  Not  until  1900  were  the  major  blood  groups  (A,  B,  AB,  and  O)
recognized, making transfusions safe and effective.

- [[effusive]] 

 (1) Given to excessive display of feeling. (2) Freely expressed. 

• At the victory party she lavished effusive praise on all her supporters for almost half an hour. 

Since to effuse is to “pour out,” an effusive person makes a habit of pouring out emotions. Greeting
someone effusively may include great hugs and wet kisses. Academy Award winners tend to become
embarrassingly  effusive  once  they've  got  the  microphone.  But  at  least  effusiveness  is  generally  an
expression of positive rather than negative emotions.

- [[profusion]] 

 Great abundance. 

• In May the trees and flowers bloom with almost delirious profusion. 

A profusion is literally a “pouring forth,” so a profusion of gifts is a wealth or abundance of gifts. A
profusely  illustrated  book  is  filled  to  overflowing  with  pictures.  A  bad  social  error  should  be
followed by profuse apologies, and profound gratitude should be expressed with profuse thanks.

- [[suffuse]] 

 To spread over or fill something, as if by fluid or light. 

• As the soft light of dawn suffused the landscape, they could hear the loons crying over the lake. 

The odors of baking may suffuse a room, and so may the light of a sunset. A face may be suffused (that
is, filled, but also probably flushed) with joy, or hope, or love. A novel may be suffused with Irish
humor, and a room may be suffused with firelight. Scientists may even describe an insect's gray wings
as being suffused with tinges of red.

apologia 

 A defense, especially of one's own ideas, opinions, or actions. 

• His resignation speech was an eloquent apologia for his controversial actions as chairman. 

An  apologia  and  an  apology  usually  aren't  the  same  thing.  An  apology  includes  an  admission  of
wrongdoing, but an apologia rarely apologizes in this sense, instead seeking to justify what was done.
So,  for  example,  in  1992  some  of  the  books  published  for  the  500th  anniversary  of  Columbus's
voyage were apologias explaining why European powers such as Spain acted as they did in the New
World: because, for example, the Aztecs were a cruel people, practicing human sacrifice in grotesque
ways (victims were skinned, and their skins were worn by the high priests), and Christianity hoped to
reform them. Of course, the Spanish Inquisition was torturing and executing nonbelievers at the same
time—but that would be the subject of other apologias.

- [[atrium]] 
skylight in a many-storied building. 

 (1) An open rectangular patio around which a house is built. (2) A court with a

•  Best  of  all,  their  new  home  had  a  large  atrium,  where  they  could  eat  breakfast  in  the  fresh  air  in
spring and summer. 

In malls and grand office buildings today, the enclosed atrium, often with full-size trees growing in it
and  high  indoor  balconies  with  hanging  vines,  has  become  a  common  architectural  feature.  But  the
original atria (notice the unusual plural) were open to the sky and occupied the center of a house or
villa in ancient Rome. The open Roman courtyard allowed air to circulate and light to enter, and even
its plantings helped cool the house. Situating the cooking fireplace in the atrium was another way of
keeping the house itself cool. Still today, houses around the Mediterranean Sea and in tropical Latin
America often have internal courtyards.

- [[oligarchy]] 

 A government in which power is in the hands of a small group. 

• The population was shackled by an iron-willed oligarchy that dictated every aspect of their lives
and ruthlessly crushed any hint of rebellion. 

Oligarchy combines roots from the Greek words oligos, meaning “few,” and archos, meaning “leader
or  ruler.”  In  ancient  Greece,  an  aristocracy  was  government  by  the  “best”  (in  Greek,  aristos)
citizens.  An  oligarchy  was  a  corrupted  aristocracy,  one  in  which  a  few  evil  men  unjustly  seized
power and used it to further their own ends. Since at least 1542, oligarchy has been used in English
to describe oppressive governments of the kind that serve the interests of a few very wealthy families.

- [[encomium]] 

 Glowing, enthusiastic praise, or an expression of such praise. 

•  The  surprise  guest  at  the  farewell  party  was  the  school's  most  famous  graduate,  who  delivered  a
heartfelt encomium to the woman he called his favorite teacher of all. 

Encomium comes straight from Latin. Mark Antony's encomium to the dead Caesar in Shakespeare's
Julius  Caesar  (“Friends,  Romans,  countrymen,  lend  me  your  ears”)  is  one  of  the  most  famous
encomiums  of  all  time,  while  Ben  Jonson's  encomium  to  the  dead  Shakespeare  (“He  was  not  of  an
age, but for all time”) has also been widely read and discussed. The British poet laureate is expected
to compose poetic encomiums to mark special events or to praise a person honored by the state. And
any awards banquet is thick with encomiums, with each speaker trying to outdo the last in praise of
those being honored.

- [[neurosis]] 
involve various pains, anxieties, or phobias. 

 A mental and emotional disorder that is less severe than a psychosis and may

• He has a neurosis about dirt, and is constantly washing his hands. 

A  neurosis  is  a  somewhat  mild  mental  disorder;  unexplained  anxiety  attacks,  unreasonable  fears,
depression, and physical symptoms that are mentally caused are all examples of neurotic conditions.
A  superstitious  person  who  compulsively  knocks  on  wood  or  avoids  anything  with  the  number  13
might  be  suffering  from  a  harmless  neurosis.  But  a  severe  neurosis  such  as  agoraphobia  (see
agoraphobia) can be very harmful, making a person a prisoner of his or her home. Neurosis is based
on the Greek word for “nerve,” since until quite recently neurotic behavior was often blamed on the
nerves. Neurosis is usually contrasted with psychosis, which includes a considerably more serious
group of conditions.

- [[opprobrium]] 
from conduct considered wrong or bad. 

 (1) Something that brings disgrace. (2) A public disgrace that results

•  The  writers  of  the  New  Testament  hold  the  Pharisees  up  to  opprobrium  for  their  hypocrisy  and
hollow spirituality. 

Witches have long been the objects of opprobrium; in Europe in the 16th and 17th centuries, women
thought to be witches were burned by the thousands. The opprobrious crime of treason could likewise
result in the most hideous torture and execution. In The Scarlet Letter, the sin of adultery in Puritan
times brought opprobrium on Hester Prynne. Today the country of Israel is the object of opprobrium
in many countries, while the Palestinians suffer similar opprobrium in others. And mere smokers, or
even overweight people, may sometimes feel themselves to be the objects of mild opprobrium.

- [[referendum]] 
or rejection. (2) A vote on such a measure. 

 (1) The referring of legislative measures to the voters for approval

• The referendum on the tax needed for constructing the new hospital passed by seven votes. 

Referendum is a Latin word, but its modern meaning only dates from the 19th century, when a new
constitution adopted by Switzerland stated that the voters could vote directly on certain issues. Thus,
a referendum is a measure that's referred (that is, sent on) to the people. Since the U.S. Constitution
doesn't provide for referenda (notice the common plural form) at the national level, referenda tend to
be on local and state issues. In most locales, a few questions usually appear on the ballot at election
time, often involving such issues as new zoning ordinances, new taxes for schools, and new limits on
spending.

- [[ultimatum]] 
will result in forceful action. 

 A final proposal, condition, or demand, especially one whose rejection

• The ultimatum to Iraq in 1991 demanding that it withdraw from Kuwait was ignored, and a U.S.-led
invasion was the response. 

An  ultimatum  is  usually  issued  by  a  stronger  power  to  a  weaker  one,  since  it  wouldn't  carry  much
weight if the one giving the ultimatum couldn't back up its threat. Near the end of World War II, the
Allied powers issued an ultimatum to Japan: surrender completely or face the consequences. Japan
rejected  the  ultimatum,  and  within  days  the  U.S.  had  dropped  atomic  bombs  on  Hiroshima  and
Nagasaki, killing some 200,000 people.
