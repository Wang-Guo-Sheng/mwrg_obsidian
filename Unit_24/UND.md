- UND  comes  into  English  from  the  Latin  words  unda, “wave,” and undare,  “to  rise  in  waves,”  “to
surge or flood.” Undulations are waves or wavelike things or motions, and to undulate is to rise and
fall in a wavelike way.

- [[undulant]] 

 (1) Rising and falling in waves. (2) Wavy in form, outline, or surface. 

• The man's undulant, sinister movements reminded her of a poisonous snake about to strike. 

The surface of a freshly plowed field is undulant. A range of rolling hills could be called undulant, as
could the shifting sands of the Sahara. A waterbed mattress is often literally undulant. And a field of
wheat will undulate or sway in the wind, like the waves of the sea.

- [[inundate]] 

 (1) To cover with a flood or overflow. (2) To overwhelm. 

•  As  news  of  the  singer's  death  spread,  retailers  were  inundated  with  orders  for  all  his  old
recordings. 

In  the  summer  of  1993,  record  rains  in  the  Midwest  caused  the  Mississippi  River  to  overflow  its
banks, break through levees, and inundate the entire countryside; such an inundation hadn't been seen
for  at  least  a  hundred  years.  By  contrast,  the  Nile  River  inundated  its  entire  valley  every  year,
bringing  the  rich  black  silt  that  made  the  valley  one  of  the  most  fertile  places  on  earth.  (The
inundations ceased with the completion of the Aswan High Dam in 1970.) Whenever a critical issue
is being debated, the White House and Congressional offices are inundated with phone calls and e-
mails,  just  as  a  town  may  be  inundated  with  complaints  when  it  starts  charging  a  fee  for  garbage
pickup.

- [[redound]] 

 (1) To have an effect for good or bad. (2) To rebound or reflect. 

• Each new military victory redounded to the glory of the king, whose brilliance as a leader was now
praised and feared throughout Europe. 

Redound  has  had  a  confusing  history.  Its  original  meaning  was  simply  “overflow.”  But  since  the
prefix re- [[often]] means “back,” the later meaning “result” may have arisen because flowing back—on
a beach, for example—is a result of the original flowing. Redound has long been confused with other
words  such  as  resound  and  rebound,  so  today  “rebound”  is  another  of  its  standard  meanings.  As
examples  of  its  usual  meaning,  we  could  say  that  the  prohibition  of  alcohol  in  1919  redounded
unintentionally  to  the  benefit  of  gangsters  such  as  Al  Capone—and  that  Capone's  jailing  on  tax-
evasion charges redounded to the credit of the famous “Untouchables.”

- [[redundancy]] 

 (1) The state of being extra or unnecessary. (2) Needless repetition. 

•  A  certain  amount  of  redundancy  can  help  make  a  speaker's  points  clear,  but  too  much  can  be
annoying. 

Redundancy, closely related to redound, has stayed close to the original meaning of “overflow” or
“more  than  necessary.”  Avoiding  redundancy  is  one  of  the  prime  rules  of  good  writing.  ““In  the
modern  world  of  today”  contains  a  redundancy;  so  does  “He  died  of  fatal  wounds”  and  “For  the
mutual  benefit  of  both  parties.”  But  redundancy  doesn't  just  occur  in  language.  “Data  redundancy”
means  keeping  the  same  computer  data  in  more  than  one  place  as  a  safety  measure,  and  a  backup
system in an airplane may provide redundancy, again for the sake of safety.
