- DYS comes from Greek, where it means “bad” or “difficult.” So dysphagia is difficult swallowing,
and  dyspnea  is  difficult  or  labored  breathing.  Dysphasia  is  an  inability  to  use  and  understand
language because of injury to or disease of the brain. Dys- [[is]] sometimes close in meaning to dis- (see
DIS), but try not to confuse the two.

- [[dystopia]] 

 An imaginary place where people lead dehumanized and often fearful lives. 

• For a 10-year-old British boy, boarding school could be a grim dystopia, with no comforts, harsh
punishments, and constant bullying. 

Dystopia  was  created  from  Utopia,  the  name  of  an  ideal  country  imagined  by  Sir  Thomas  More  in
1516. For More, the suffix -topia meant “place” (see TOP), and u- (from the Greek root ou) meant
“no,” but also perhaps “good” (see EU). In other words, More's Utopia was too good to be true. It's
probably no accident that dystopia was first used around 1950, soon after George Orwell published
his  famous  novel  Nineteen  Eighty-Four  and  16  years  after  Aldous  Huxley  published  Brave  New
World. These two are still the most famous of the 20th century's many depressingly dystopian novels.
And what about all those bleak futuristic films: Blade Runner, Brazil, The Matrix, and the rest? What
does it mean when no one will paint a picture of a happy future?

- [[dyslexia]] 

 A disturbance or interference with the ability to read or to use language. 

• She managed to deal with her dyslexia through careful tutoring all throughout elementary school. 

Dyslexia  is  a  neurological  disorder  that  usually  affects  people  of  average  or  superior  intelligence.
Dyslexic individuals have an impaired ability to recognize and process words and letters. Dyslexia
usually shows itself in the tendency to read and write words and letters in reversed order; sometimes
similar  reversals  occur  in  the  person's  speech.  Dyslexia  has  been  shown  to  be  treatable  through
patient instruction in proper reading techniques.

- [[dyspeptic]] 
temperament; ill-humored. 

  (1)  Relating  to  or  suffering  from  indigestion.  (2)  Having  an  irritable

• For decades the dyspeptic columnist served as the newspaper's—and the city's—resident grouch. 

Dyspepsia comes from the Greek word for “bad digestion.” Interestingly, the Greek verb pessein can
mean  either  “to  cook”  or  “to  digest”;  bad  cooking  has  been  responsible  for  a  lot  of  dyspepsia.
Dyspepsia can be caused by many diseases, but dyspeptic individuals are often the victims of their
own  habits  and  appetites.  Worry,  overeating,  inadequate  chewing,  and  excessive  smoking  and
drinking can all bring on dyspepsia. Today we generally use dyspeptic to mean “irritable”—that is, in
the kind of mood that could be produced by bad digestion.

- [[dysplasia]] 
resulting from such growth. 

  Abnormal  development  of  cells  or  organs,  or  an  abnormal  structure

• The infant was born with minor hip dysplasia, which was fixed by a routine operation. 

Of  the  dozens  of  medical  terms  that  begin  with  the  dys-  prefix,  dysplasia  (with  the  suffix  -plasia,
meaning “development”) is one of the more common, though not many nondoctors know it. Structural
dysplasias are usually something you're born with; they often involve the hip or the kidneys. But cell
dysplasia is often associated with cancer. And a dysplastic mole—a mole that changes shape in an
odd way—is always something to be concerned about.

- Latin Borrowings

a fortiori 

 All the more certainly. 

• If drug users are going to be subject to mandatory sentences, then, a fortiori, drug dealers should be
subject to them also. 

A fortiori in Latin literally means “from the stronger (argument).” The term is used when drawing a
conclusion that's even more obvious or convincing than the one just drawn. Thus, if teaching English
grammar  to  native  speakers  is  difficult,  then,  a  fortiori,  teaching  English  grammar  to  nonnative
speakers will be even more challenging.

- [[a]] posteriori 

 Relating to or derived by reasoning from known or observed facts.

• Most Presidents will come to the a posteriori conclusion that a booming economy is entirely due to
their own economic policies. 

A posteriori, Latin for “from the latter,” is a term from logic, which usually refers to reasoning that
works  backward  from  an  effect  to  its  causes.  This  kind  of  reasoning  can  sometimes  lead  to  false
conclusions. The fact that sunrise follows the crowing of a rooster, for example, doesn't necessarily
mean that the rooster's crowing caused the sun to rise.

- [[a]] priori 

 Relating to or derived by reasoning from self-evident propositions. 

•  Her  colleagues  rejected  the  a  priori  argument  because  it  rested  on  assumptions  they  felt  weren't
necessarily true. 

A priori, Latin for “from the former,” is traditionally contrasted with a posteriori (see above). The
term usually describes lines of reasoning or arguments that proceed from the general to the particular,
or from causes to effects. Whereas a posteriori knowledge is knowledge based solely on experience
or personal observation, a priori knowledge is knowledge that comes from the power of reasoning
based on self-evident truths. So, for example, “Every mother has had a child” is an a priori statement,
since  it  shows  simple  logical  reasoning  and  isn't  a  statement  of  fact  about  a  specific  case  (such  as
“This woman is the mother of five children”) that the speaker knew about from experience.

- [[bona]] fide 

 (1) Made in good faith, without deceit. (2) Authentic or genuine. 

• According to the broker, they've made a bona fide offer to buy the property. 

Bona fide means “in good faith” in Latin. When applied to business deals and the like, it stresses the
absence of fraud or deception. A bona fide sale of securities is an entirely aboveboard transaction.
Outside of business and law, bona fide implies mere sincerity and earnestness. A bona fide promise
is one that the person has every intention of keeping. A bona fide proposal of marriage is one made by
a suitor who isn't kidding around. Bona fide also has the noun form bona fides; when someone asks
about someone else's bona fides, it usually means evidence of their qualifications or achievements.

- [[carpe]] diem 
about the future. 

 Enjoy the pleasures or opportunities of the moment without concern

• When he learned the phrase “Carpe diem” in high-school Latin class, he knew he'd found the motto
he would live by for the rest of his life. 

Carpe  diem,  a  phrase  that  comes  from  the  Roman  poet  Horace,  means  literally  “Pluck  the  day,”
though it's usually translated as “Seize the day.” A free translation might be “Enjoy yourself while you
have the chance.” For some people, Carpe diem serves as the closest thing to a philosophy of life as
they'll ever have.

- [[caveat]] emptor 

 Let the buyer beware. 

• The best rule to keep in mind when buying anything from a pushcart is: “Caveat emptor.” 

“Without a warranty, the buyer must take the risk” is the basic meaning of the phrase caveat emptor. In
the days when buying and selling was carried on in the local marketplace, the rule was a practical
one. Buyer and seller knew each other and were on equal footing. The nature of modern commerce
and  technology  placed  the  buyer  at  a  disadvantage,  however,  so  a  stack  of  regulations  have  been
written by federal, state, and local agencies to protect the consumer against dangerous or defective
products, fraudulent practices, and the like. But the principle that a buyer needs a warranty if he is to
avoid risk remains an important legal concept. Note that a caveat is a small warning or explanation
intended to avoid misinterpretation.

- [[corpus]] delicti 
 (1) The substantial and basic fact or facts necessary to prove that
a crime has been committed. (2) The material substance, such as the murdered body, on which a crime
has been committed. 

•  The  police  believed  they  had  solved  the  crime,  but  couldn't  prove  their  case  without  the  corpus
delicti. 

Corpus delicti literally means “body of the crime” in Latin. In its original sense, the body in question
refers not to a corpse but to the body of essential facts that, taken together, prove that a crime has been
committed.  In  popular  usage,  corpus delicti  also  refers  to  the  actual  physical  object  upon  which  a
crime has been committed. In a case of arson, it would be a ruined building; in a murder case, the
victim's corpse.

- [[curriculum]]  vitae 
typically prepared by an applicant for a position; résumé. 

  A  short  summary  of  one's  career  and  qualifications,

• The job advertisement asked for an up-to-date curriculum vitae and three recommendations. 

The Latin phrase curriculum vitae, often abbreviated CV, literally means “the course of one's life.”
The  term  is  usually  used  for  applications  for  jobs  in  the  sciences  and  medicine  and  for  teaching
positions in colleges and universities. A shorter term is simply vita, meaning “life.” In other fields,
résumé is more commonly used in the U.S.; in England, however, curriculum vitae is the usual term
for any job application.
