MAL comes from a Latin word meaning “bad.” A malady is a bad condition—a disease or illness—
of  the  body  or  mind.  Malpractice  is  bad  medical  practice.  Malodorous  things  smell  bad.  And  a
malefactor is someone guilty of bad deeds.

- [[malevolent]] 

 Having or showing intense ill will or hatred. 

• Captain Ahab sees Moby Dick not simply as a whale but as a powerfully malevolent foe. 

Malevolence runs deep. Malevolent enemies have bitter and lasting feelings of ill will. Malevolent
racism and bigotry can erupt in acts of violence against innocent people. Malevolence can also show
itself in hurtful words, and can sometimes be seen in something as small as an angry look or gesture.

- [[malicious]] 

 Desiring to cause pain, injury, or distress to another. 

• The boys didn't take the apples with any malicious intent; they were just hungry and didn't know any
better. 

Malicious  and  malevolent  are  close  in  meaning,  since  both  refer  to  ill  will  that  desires  to  see
someone else suffer. But while malevolent suggests deep and lasting dislike, malicious usually means
petty and spiteful. Malicious gossipers are often simply envious of a neighbor's good fortune. Vandals
may  take  malicious  pleasure  in  destroying  and  defacing  property  but  usually  don't  truly  hate  the
owners. Malice is an important legal concept, which has to be proved in order to convict someone of
certain crimes such as first-degree murder.

- [[malign]] 

 To make harsh and often false or misleading statements about. 

•  Captain  Bligh  of  the  Bounty  may  be  one  of  the  most  unjustly  maligned  figures  in  British  naval
history. 

Malign is related to verbs like defame, slander, and libel. The person or group being maligned is the
victim  of  false  or  misleading  statements,  even  if  the  maligner  isn't  necessarily  guilty  of  deliberate
lying. Someone or something that's frequently criticized is often said to be “much maligned,” which
suggests  that  the  criticism  isn't  entirely  fair  or  deserved.  Malign  is  also  an  adjective,  and  writers
often refer to a person's malign influence. The very similar malignant, which used to be a common
synonym  of  malign,  today  tends  to  describe  dangerous  medical  conditions,  especially  cancerous
tumors.

- [[malnourished]] 

 Badly or poorly nourished. 

•  When  they  finally  found  the  children  in  the  locked  cabin,  they  were  pale  and  malnourished  but
unharmed. 

Malnourished people can be found in all types of societies. Famine and poverty are only two of the
common causes of malnutrition. In wealthier societies, malnutrition is often the result of poor eating
habits.  Any  diet  that  fails  to  provide  the  nutrients  needed  for  health  and  growth  can  lead  to
malnutrition, and some malnourished people are actually fat.

- CATA  comes  from  the  Greek  kata,  one  of  whose  meanings  was  “down.”  A  catalogue  is  a  list  of
