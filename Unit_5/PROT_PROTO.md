- PROT/PROTO  comes  from  Greek  and  has  the  basic  meaning  “first  in  time”  or  “first  formed.”
Protozoa  are  one-celled  animals,  such  as  amoebas  and  paramecia,  that  are  among  the  most  basic
members of the biological kingdom. A proton is an elementary particle that, along with neutrons, can
be  found  in  all  atomic  nuclei.  A  protoplanet  is  a  whirling  mass  of  gas  and  dust  that  astronomers
believe may someday become a planet.

- [[protagonist]] 

 The main character in a literary work. 

• Macbeth is the ruthlessly ambitious protagonist of Shakespeare's play, but it is his wife who pulls
the strings. 

Struggle, or conflict, is central to drama. The protagonist or hero of a play, novel, or film is involved
in a struggle of some kind, either against someone or something else or even against his or her own
emotions. So the hero is the “first struggler,” which is the literal meaning of the Greek word pr tag
nist s. A character who opposes the hero is the antagonist, from a Greek verb that means literally
“to struggle against.”

- [[protocol]] 
the formatting of data in an electronic communications system. 

 (1) A code of diplomatic or military rules of behavior. (2) A set of rules for

•  The  guests  at  the  governor's  dinner  were  introduced  and  seated  according  to  the  strict  protocol
governing such occasions. 

The basic meaning of proto- [[is]] a little harder to follow in this word. Protocol comes from a Greek
word  for  the  first  sheet  of  a  papyrus  roll.  In  English,  protocol  originally  meant  “a  first  draft  or
record,”  and  later  specifically  the  first  draft  of  a  diplomatic  document,  such  as  a  treaty.  The
“diplomatic”  connection  led  eventually  to  its  current  meaning  of  “rules  of  behavior.”  Someone
wearing  Bermuda  shorts  and  sandals  to  a  state  dinner  at  the  White  House  would  not  be  acting
“according to protocol,” and royal protocol forbids touching the queen of England except to shake her
hand.  But  protocol  is  also  now  used  for  other  sets  of  rules,  such  as  those  for  doing  a  scientific
experiment or for handling computer data.

- [[protoplasm]] 

 The substance that makes up the living parts of cells. 

• A mixture of organic and inorganic substances, such as protein and water, protoplasm is regarded as
the physical basis of life. 

After the word protoplasm  was  coined  in  the  mid-19th  century  for  the  jellylike  material  that  is  the
main substance of a cell, it began to be used widely, especially by scientists and others who imagined
that the first life-forms must have arisen out of a great seething protoplasmic soup. Since protoplasm
includes all the cell's living material, inside and outside the nucleus, it is a less useful scientific word
today than more precise terms such as cytoplasm, which refers only to the living material outside the
nucleus. But many remain fascinated by the image of that soup bubbling away as the lightning flashes
and the volcanoes erupt.

- [[prototype]] 
scale, usually working version of a new type or design. 

  (1)  An  original  model  on  which  something  is  patterned.  (2)  A  first,  full-

• There was great excitement when, after years of top-secret development, the prototype of the new
Stealth bomber first took to the skies. 

A prototype is someone or something that serves as a model or inspiration. A successful fund-raising
campaign can serve as a prototype for future campaigns, for example, and the legendary Robin Hood
is the prototypical honorable outlaw, the inspiration for countless other romantic heroes. But the term
is perhaps most widely used in the world of technology; every new “concept car,” for example, starts
off as a unique prototype.

- ANTE is Latin for “before” or “in front of.” Antediluvian,  which  describes  something  very  old  or
