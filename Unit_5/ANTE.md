- ANTE is Latin for “before” or “in front of.” Antediluvian,  which  describes  something  very  old  or
outdated, literally means “before the flood”—that is, Noah's Flood. And antebellum literally means
“before the war,” usually the American Civil War.

- [[antechamber]] 
room. 

 An outer room that leads to another and is often used as a waiting

• The antechamber to the lawyer's office was both elegant and comfortable, designed to inspire trust
and confidence. 

One  expects  to  find  an  antechamber  outside  the  private  chambers  of  a  Supreme  Court  Justice  or
leading  into  the  great  hall  of  a  medieval  castle.  In  the  private  end  of  the  castle  the  lord's  or  lady's
bedchamber would have its own antechamber, which served as a dressing room and sitting room, but
could also house bodyguards if the castle came under siege. Anteroom is a less formal synonym, one
that's often applied to the waiting rooms of professional offices today.

- [[antedate]] 
writing. (2) To precede in time. 

 (1) To date something (such as a check) with a date earlier than that of actual

• Nantucket Island has hundreds of beautifully preserved houses that antedate the Civil War. 

Dinosaurs antedated the first human beings by almost 65 million years, though this stubborn fact never
used to stop cartoonists and screenwriters from having the two species inhabit the same story line.
Dictionary  editors  are  constantly  noticing  how  the  oral  use  of  a  word  may  antedate  its  first
appearance in print by a number of years. Antedating a check or a contract isn't illegal unless it's done
for the purpose of fraud (the same is true of its opposite, postdating).

- [[antecedent]] 
(2) An event or cause coming before something. 

 (1) A word or phrase that is referred to by a pronoun that follows it.

• As I remember, she said “My uncle is taking my father, and he's staying overnight,” but I'm not sure
what the antecedent of “he” was. 

A basic principle of clear writing is to keep your antecedents clear. Pronouns are often used in order
not to repeat a noun (so instead of saying “Sheila turns 22 tomorrow, and Sheila is having a party,”
we  replace  the  second  “Sheila”  with  “she”).  But  sloppy  writers  sometimes  leave  their  antecedents
unclear (for instance, “Sheila helps Kathleen out, but she doesn't appreciate it,” where it isn't clear
who “she” is). Watch out for this possible problem when using not just he and she but also they, them,
it, this, and that. And keep in mind that antecedent isn't just a grammar term. You may talk about the
antecedents of heart disease (such as bad eating habits), the antecedents of World War II (such as the
unwise Treaty of Versailles), and even your own antecedents (your mother, grandfather, etc.).

- [[anterior]] 
development. 

 (1) Located before or toward the front or head. (2) Coming before in time or

•  When  she  moved  up  to  join  the  first-class  passengers  in  the  plane's  anterior  section,  she  was
delighted to recognize the governor in the next seat. 

Anterior  generally  appears  in  either  medical  or  scholarly  contexts.  Anatomy  books  refer  to  the
anterior  lobe  of  the  brain,  the  anterior  cerebral  artery,  the  anterior  facial  vein,  etc.  Scholar  and
lawyers may use anterior to mean “earlier in time or order.” For example, supporters of states' rights
point  out  that  the  individual  states  enjoyed  certain  rights  anterior  to  their  joining  the  union.  And
prenuptial agreements are designed to protect the assets that one or both parties acquired anterior to
the marriage.
