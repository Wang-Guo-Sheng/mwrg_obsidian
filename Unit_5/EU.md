- EU comes from the Greek word for “well”; in English words it can also mean “good” or “true.” A
veterinarian who performs euthanasia is providing a very sick or hopelessly injured animal a “good”
or easy death.

- [[eugenic]] 
breeding. 

  Relating  to  or  fitted  for  the  production  of  good  offspring  through  controlled

• Eugenic techniques have been part of sheep breeding for many years. 

The  word  eugenic,  like  the  name  Eugene,  includes  the  Greek  root  meaning  “born”  (see  GEN).
Breeders  of  farm  animals  have  long  used  eugenic  methods  to  produce  horses  that  run  faster,  for
example, or pigs that provide more meat. Through eugenics, Holstein cows have become one of the
world's highest producers of milk. But eugenics also has a dark side. The idea of human eugenics was
taken up enthusiastically by the Nazis in the 20th century, with terrible consequences.

- [[euphemism]] 
one that may offend or disgust. 

 An agreeable or inoffensive word or expression that is substituted for

• The Victorians, uncomfortable with the physical side of human existence, had euphemisms for most
bodily functions. 

The use of euphemisms is an ancient part of the English language, and perhaps of all languages, and
all  of  us  use  them.  Golly  and  gosh  started  out  as  euphemisms  for  God,  and  darn  is  a  familiar
euphemism  for  damn.  Shoot,  shucks,  and  sugar  are  all  euphemistic  substitutes  for  a  well-known
vulgar word. Pass away for die, misspeak for lie, downsize for fire, senior citizen for old person—
the list goes on and on.

- [[euphoria]] 

 A strong feeling of well-being or happiness. 

• Swept up in the euphoria of a Super Bowl victory, the whole city seemed to have poured out into the
streets. 

Euphoria  is  the  feeling  of  an  intense  (and  usually  temporary)  “high.”  Doctors  use  the  word  for  the
kind of abnormal or inappropriate high spirits that might be caused by a drug or by mental illness, but
euphoria is usually natural and appropriate. When we win enough money in the lottery to buy several
small Pacific islands, or even just when the home team wins the championship, we have good reason
to feel euphoric.

- [[eulogy]] 
praise. 

  (1)  A  formal  speech  or  writing  especially  in  honor  of  a  dead  person.  (2)  High

• The book was a fond eulogy to the 1950s, when Americans had joined social organizations of all
kinds. 

With its -logy ending (see LOG), eulogy means literally something like “good speech.” We are told to
speak only good of the dead, but a eulogist actually makes a speech in the dead person's honor—or
often  instead  for  someone  living,  who  might  actually  be  there  in  the  audience.  The  most  famous
eulogies  include  Lincoln's  Gettysburg  Address  and  Pericles'  funeral  oration  for  the  Athenian
warriors; but these are only two of the many great eulogies, which continue to be delivered not only at
funerals and memorial services but at retirement parties, anniversary parties, and birthday parties.

- DYS comes from Greek, where it means “bad” or “difficult.” So dysphagia is difficult swallowing,
