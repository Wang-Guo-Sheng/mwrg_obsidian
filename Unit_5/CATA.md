- CATA  comes  from  the  Greek  kata,  one  of  whose  meanings  was  “down.”  A  catalogue  is  a  list  of
items put down on paper, and a catapult is a weapon for hurling missiles down on one's enemies.

- [[cataclysm]] 
momentous event that results in great upheaval and often destruction. 

  (1)  A  violent  and  massive  change  of  the  earth's  surface.  (2)  A

• World War I was a great cataclysm in modern history, marking the end of the old European social
and political order. 

The -clysm part of cataclysm comes from the Greek word meaning “to wash,” so cataclysm's original
meaning  was  “flood,  deluge,”  and  especially  Noah's  Flood  itself.  A  cataclysm  causes  great  and
lasting  changes.  An  earthquake  or  other  natural  disaster  that  changes  the  landscape  is  one  kind  of
cataclysm, but a violent political revolution may also be a cataclysmic event. Many cataclysms could
instead be called catastrophes.

- [[catacomb]] 
tombs. 

  An  underground  cemetery  of  connecting  passageways  with  recesses  for

• The early Christian catacombs of Rome provide a striking glimpse into the ancient past for modern-
day visitors. 

About forty Christian catacombs have been found near the roads that once led into Rome. After the
decline  of  the  Roman  empire  these  cemeteries  were  forgotten,  not  to  be  rediscovered  until  1578.
Catacomb  has  come  to  refer  to  different  kinds  of  underground  chambers  and  passageways.  The
catacombs  of  Paris  are  abandoned  stone  quarries  that  were  not  used  for  burials  until  1787.  The
catacombs built by a monastery in Palermo, Sicily, for its deceased members later began accepting
bodies from outside the monastery; today you may wander through looking at hundreds of mummified
corpses propped against the catacomb walls, dressed in tattered clothes that were once fashionable.

- [[catalyst]] 
 (1) A substance that speeds up a chemical reaction or lets it take place under
different  conditions.  (2)  Someone  or  something  that  brings  about  or  speeds  significant  change  or
action. 

• The assassination of Archduke Ferdinand in Sarajevo in 1914 turned out to be the catalyst for World
War I. 

Chemical  catalysts  are  substances  that,  in  very  small  amounts,  can  bring  about  important  chemical
changes  in  large  quantities  of  material.  The  catalytic  converter  in  your  car's  exhaust  system,  for
instance,  uses  tiny  amounts  of  platinum  to  swiftly  convert  the  engine's  dangerous  gases  to  carbon
dioxide and water vapor. And it's easy to see how the meaning of catalyst could broaden to include
nonchemical situations. We can now say, for example, that the Great Depression served as the catalyst
for such important social reforms as Social Security.

- [[catatonic]] 
unusual lack of movement, activity, or expression. 

 (1) Relating to or suffering from a form of schizophrenia. (2) Showing an

• After an hour, extreme boredom had produced a catatonic stupor in those of the audience who were
still awake. 

Catatonia is primarily a form of the terrible mental disease known as schizophrenia, though it may
show  up  in  patients  with  a  variety  of  other  mental  conditions.  A  common  symptom  is  extreme
muscular rigidity; catatonic patients may be “frozen” for hours or even days in a single position. Its
causes remain mysterious. Serious though the condition is, most nondoctors use catatonic humorously
to describe people who seem incapable of moving or changing expression.
