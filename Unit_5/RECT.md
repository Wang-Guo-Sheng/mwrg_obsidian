- RECT comes from the Latin word rectus, which means “straight” or “right.” To correct something is
to make it right. A rectangle is a four-sided figure with straight parallel sides. Rectus, short for Latin
rectus musculus, may refer to any of several straight muscles, such as those of the abdomen.

- [[rectitude]] 

 Moral integrity. 

•  The  school  superintendent  was  stern  and  not  terribly  popular,  but  no  one  questioned  her  moral
rectitude. 

We  associate  straightness  with  honesty,  so  if  we  suspect  someone  is  lying  we  might  ask  if  they're
being “straight” with us, and we might call a lawbreaker crooked or label him a crook. Rectitude may
sound a little old-fashioned today, but the virtue it represents never really goes out of style.

- [[rectify]] 

 To set right; remedy. 

• The college is moving to rectify this unfortunate situation before anyone else gets hurt. 

We rectify something by straightening it out or making it right. We might rectify an injustice by seeing
to  it  that  a  wrongly  accused  person  is  cleared.  An  error  in  a  financial  record  can  be  rectified  by
replacing an incorrect number with a correct one. If the error is in our tax return, the Internal Revenue
Service will be happy to rectify it for us; we might then have to rectify the impression that we were
trying to cheat on our taxes.

- [[rectilinear]] 
lines. 

  (1)  Moving  in  or  forming  a  straight  line.  (2)  Having  many  straight

• After admiring Frank Lloyd Wright's rectilinear buildings for years, the public was astonished by
the giant spiral of the Guggenheim Museum. 

Rectilinear  patterns  or  constructions  are  those  in  which  straight  lines  are  strikingly  obvious.  In
geometry,  rectilinear  usually  means  “perpendicular”;  thus,  a  rectilinear  polygon  is  a  many-sided
shape  whose  angles  are  all  right  angles  (the  footprints  of  most  houses,  with  their  extensions  and
garages,  are  good  examples).  But  rectilinear  is  particularly  used  in  physics.  Rectilinear  motion  is
motion in which the speed remains constant and the path is a straight line; and rectilinear rays, such as
light rays, travel in a straight line.

- [[directive]] 
level body or official. 

 Something that guides or directs; especially, a general instruction from a high-

•  At  the  very  beginning  of  the  administration,  the  cabinet  secretary  had  sent  out  a  directive  to  all
border-patrol personnel. 

As  the  definition  states,  a  directive  directs.  A  directive  from  a  school  principal  might  provide
guidance about handling holiday celebrations in class. A directive from the Vatican might specify new
wording for the Mass in various languages. Even the European Union issues directives to its member
countries, which they often ignore.
