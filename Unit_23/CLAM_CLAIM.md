- CLAM/CLAIM comes from the Latin verb clamare, meaning “to shout or cry out.” To claim often
means “to call for.” And an exclamation is a cry of shock, joy, or surprise.

- [[clamor]] 
demand. 

  (1)  Noisy  shouting;  loud,  continuous  noise.  (2)  Strong  and  active  protest  or

• The clamor in the hallways between classes was particularly loud that morning as news of the state
championship swept through the student body. 

The clamor on Broadway at midday can be astonishing to a tourist from a midwestern town; if they
happen to be digging up the street with jackhammers, the clamor can be even worse. The clamor on
the floor of a stock exchange goes on without stopping for seven hours every day. A clamor of protest
may sometimes be quieter, but is often just as hard to ignore. A politican who receives a thousand e-
mails a day clamoring for his resignation might as well be listening to an angry crowd.

- [[acclamation]] 
An overwhelming yes vote by cheers, shouts, or applause. 

 (1) A loud, eager indication of approval, praise, or agreement. (2)

•  To  the  principal's  suggestion  that  Friday  be  a  holiday  to  honor  the  victors  in  the  national  math
olympics, the students yelled their approval in a long and loud acclamation. 

Approval can come from a single person, but acclamation requires a larger audience. An acclaimed
movie  is  widely  praised,  and  critical  acclaim  can  lead  to  box-office  success.  When  a  popular
proposal  comes  up  in  a  legislature,  the  speaker  may  ask  that  it  be  passed  “by  acclamation,”  which
means that everyone just gets to yell and cheer in approval and no one bothers counting the votes at
all.

- [[declaim]] 

 To speak in the formal manner of someone delivering a speech. 

• Almost any opinion can sound convincing if it's declaimed loudly and with conviction. 

Declaiming  suggests  an  unnatural  style  of  speech  best  suited  to  a  stage  or  podium.  Listening  to  an
actor  declaim  a  passage  in  a  Shakespeare  play  can  be  enjoyable.  Listening  to  Aunt  Ida  at  Sunday
dinner declaiming on the virtues of roughage might not be. Most people don't appreciate being treated
as an audience, and good advice is usually more welcome when it's not given in a declamatory style.

- [[proclaim]] 

 To declare or announce publicly, officially, or definitely. 

•  He  burst  into  the  dorm  room,  jumped  onto  his  bed,  and  proclaimed  that  he  had  just  aced  the
sociology exam. 

The pro- [[in]] proclaim means “forward, out,” so a proclamation is an “outward” statement intended
for  the  public.  We  often  think  of  proclamations  as  something  issued  by  monarchs  or  dictators,  but
Lincoln was able to issue his Emancipation Proclamation because as president he had the power to
free the slaves in certain areas. At a slightly lower level, a governor may proclaim a day in honor of
the state's firemen, a movie critic may proclaim a director to be the best of all, or you may proclaim
your New Year's resolutions to a crowd of friends.

- CRAC/CRAT comes from the Greek word meaning “power.” Attached to another root, it indicates
