TEXT comes from a Latin verb that means “to weave.” So a textile is a woven or knitted cloth. The
material  it's  made  from  determines  its  texture,  the  smoothness  or  roughness  of  its  surface.  And
individual words are “woven” into sentences and paragraphs to form a text.

- [[textual]] 

 Having to do with or based on a text. 

• A textual analysis of 1,700 lipstick names, including Hot Mama and Raisin Hell, suggested to the
author that the women buying them lack a healthy sense of self-worth. 

Before the invention of the printing press, books were produced by hand. When the text of a book is
copied this way, textual errors can creep in, and a text that's been copied again and again can contain
many such errors. By comparing different copies of a work, textual critics try to figure out where the
copyists went wrong and restore the text to its original form so that modern readers can again enjoy
the correct versions of ancient texts. When a class performs textual analysis of a poem, however, they
are looking closely at its individual words and phrases in an effort to determine the poem's meanings.

- [[context]] 
occurs. (2) The conditions or circumstances in which an event occurs; environment or setting. 

  (1)  The  surrounding  spoken  or  written  material  in  which  a  word  or  remark

•  The  governor  claimed  that  his  remarks  were  taken  out  of  context  and  that  anyone  looking  at  the
whole speech would get a different impression. 

Context reveals meaning. The context of an unfamiliar word can give us contextual clues to help us
determine  what  the  word  means.  Taking  a  remark  out  of  context  can  change  its  meaning  entirely.
Likewise,  people's  actions  sometimes  have  to  be  understood  as  having  occurred  in  a  particular
context. The behavior of historical figures should be seen in the context of their time, when standards
may have been very different from our own.

- [[hypertext]] 
can be accessed directly from the screen (as by a mouse click). 

 A database format in which information related to that on a display screen

•  Three  days  ago  my  mother  was  asking  me  why  some  of  the  words  are  underlined  in  blue,  but  by
yesterday she was already an expert in hypertext. 

Since  hyper-  generally  means  “above,  beyond”  (see  HYPER),  hypertext  is  something  that's  gone
beyond  the  limitations  of  ordinary  text.  Thus,  unlike  the  text  in  a  book,  hypertext  permits  you,  by
clicking with a mouse, to immediately access text in one of millions of different electronic sources.
Hypertext  is  now  so  familiar  that  most  computer  users  may  not  even  know  the  word,  which  was
coined by Ted Nelson back in the early 1960s. It took a few more years for hypertext to actually be
created, by Douglas Engelbart, and then quite a few more years before the introduction of the World
Wide Web in 1991.

- [[subtext]] 

 The underlying meaning of a spoken or written passage. 

• The tough and cynical tone of the story is contradicted by its romantic subtext. 

A literary text often has more than one meaning: the literal meaning of the words on the page, and their
hidden meaning, what exists “between the lines”—the subtext. Arthur Miller's play The Crucible, for
example, is about the Salem witchcraft trials of the 17th century, but its subtext is the comparison of
those trials with the “witch hunts” of the 1950s, when many people were unfairly accused of being
communists. Even a social conversation between a man and a woman may have a subtext, but you may
have  to  listen  very  closely  to  figure  out  what  it  is.  Don't  confuse  subtext  with  subplot,  a  less
important plot that moves along in parallel with the main plot.

- PLAC comes from the Latin placere, “to please or be agreeable to,” or placare, “to soothe or calm.”
