- PUNC comes from the Latin noun punctum, meaning “point.” A period is a form of punctuation that's
literally a point, and a punctured tire has been pricked by a sharp point.

- [[punctilious]] 

 Very careful about the details of codes or conventions. 

• A proofreader has to be punctilious about spelling and punctuation. 

A punctilio is a small point—a minor rule, or a little detail of conduct in a ceremony. A person who
pays close attention to such minor details is punctilious. Punctiliousness can be valuable, especially
for certain kinds of tasks, as long as you don't become so concerned about small points that you fail to
pay attention to the large ones.

- [[punctual]] 

 Being on time; prompt. 

• The company had become much more punctual under the new president, and every meeting started
precisely on time. 

The original meaning of punctual described a puncture made by a surgeon. The word has meant lots
of other things through the centuries, usually involving being precise about small points. And today
punctuality is all about time; a punctual train or a punctual payment or a punctual person shows up
“on the dot.”

- [[compunction]] 

 (1) Anxiety caused by guilt. (2) A slight misgiving. 

•  Speeding  is  something  many  people  seem  to  do  without  compunction,  their  only  concern  being
whether they'll get caught. 

Compunction is most often used in describing people who don't feel it—that is, who aren't “stung” or
“pricked”  by  conscience.  Ruthless  businessmen  steal  clients  and  contracts  from  other  businessmen
without compunction, and hardened criminals have no compunctions about armed robbery and worse.
Notice  how  compunction  can  be  used  in  a  noncountable  way,  like  guilt  (“He  killed  without
compunction”), or in the plural, like qualm (”She had no compunctions about lying”). But words like
guilt, qualm, regret, remorse, doubt, and unease, unlike compunction, are often used when talking
about people who actually suffer from them.

- [[acupuncture]] 
needles through the skin at specific points. 

 A method of relieving pain or curing illness by inserting fine

• As a last resort he agreed to try acupuncture treatment with Dr. Lu, and his pain vanished like magic.

In Latin, acus means “needle,” and the English word acupuncture was coined way back in the 17th
century to describe a technique the Chinese had already been using for 2,000 years. An acupuncturist
may insert many extremely fine needles at a time; the treatment is usually uncomfortable but not truly
painful. In China today, even major surgery is often carried out using only acupuncture to kill the pain;
it's  also  used  for  many  other  conditions,  including  insomnia,  depression,  smoking,  and  overweight.
Acupuncture  is  based  on  ancient  theories  of  bodily  energy  that  few  Western  doctors  have  ever
accepted; but even though attempts to explain its effects by Western science have been unsuccessful,
it's now widely recognized by doctors as effective for pain reduction.
