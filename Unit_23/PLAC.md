- PLAC comes from the Latin placere, “to please or be agreeable to,” or placare, “to soothe or calm.”
Pleasant, pleasurable,  and  pleasing  all  derive  from  this  root,  even  though  their  spelling  makes  it
hard to see.

- [[placate]] 

 To calm the anger or bitterness of someone. 

•  The  Romans  had  a  number  of  ways  of  placating  the  gods,  which  occasionally  included  burying
slaves alive. 

Politicians  are  constantly  having  to  placate  angry  voters.  Diplomats  frequently  need  to  placate  a
country's  allies  or  possible  enemies.  Parents  are  always  placating  kids  who  think  they've  been
unfairly denied something. And lovers and spouses are some of the champion placaters. It's no secret
that  people  with  the  best  social  skills  are  often  the  best  at  placating  other  people—and  that  they
themselves may be the ones who benefit the most by it.

- [[placebo]] 
for experimental purposes or to soothe the patient. 

 A harmless substance given to a patient in place of genuine medication, either

• The placebo worked miraculously: his skin rash cleared up, his sleep improved, and he even ceased
to hear voices. 

Doctors doing research on new treatments for disease often give one group a placebo while a second
group takes the new medication. Since those in the placebo group usually believe they're getting the
real thing, their own hopeful attitude may bring about improvement in their condition. Thus, for the
real drug to be considered effective, it must produce even better results than the placebo. Placebos
have  another  use  as  well.  A  doctor  who  suspects  that  a  patient's  physical  symptoms  are
psychologically produced may prescribe a placebo in the hope that mentally produced symptoms can
also be mentally cured.

- [[placidity]] 

 Serene freedom from interruption or disturbance; calmness. 

• Her placidity seemed eerie in view of the destruction she had witnessed and the huge loss she had
suffered. 

A  placid  lake  has  a  smooth  surface  untouched  by  wind.  A  placid  scene  is  one  in  which  everything
seems calm; it may even include a meadow with a few placid cows grazing on it. Someone with a
placid  personality  has  an  inner  peacefulness  that  isn't  easily  disturbed.  As  a  personality  trait,
placidity is surely a lot better than some of the alternatives; however, the word sometimes describes
people who are also a bit passive, like those contented cows.

- [[implacable]] 

 Not capable of being pleased, satisfied, or changed. 

• Attempts to negotiate a peace settlement between such implacable enemies seem doomed to failure. 

Implacable,  with  its  negative  prefix  im-,  describes  something  or  someone  that  can't  be  calmed  or
soothed or altered. A person who carries a grudge feels an implacable resentment—a resentment that
can't  be  soothed.  An  implacable  foe  is  one  you  can't  negotiate  with,  perhaps  one  who's  fueled  by
implacable  hatred.  And  implacable  sometimes  describes  things  that  only  seem  to  be  alive:  an
implacable storm is one that seems as if it will never let up, and an implacable fate is one that you
can't outrun or hide from.
