- GRAT comes from the Latin words gratus, meaning “pleasing, welcome, or agreeable,” and gratia,
meaning “grace, agreeableness, or pleasantness.” A meal that's served graciously will be received
with gratitude by grateful guests; those who show no appreciation could be called ingrates.

- [[gratify]] 
To give in to; indulge or satisfy. 

 (1) To be a source of pleasure or satisfaction; give pleasure or satisfaction to. (2)

• It gratified him immensely to see his daughter bloom so beautifully in high school. 

A gratifying experience is quietly pleasing or satisfying. But gratifying an impulse means giving in to
it, which isn't always such a good idea, and “instant gratification” of every desire will result in a life
based  on  junk  food  and  worse.  Truly  gratifying  experiences  and  accomplishments  usually  are  the
result of time and effort.

- [[gratuity]] 

 Something, especially a tip, given freely. 

•  After  sitting  for  three  hours  over  a  six-course  meal  at  Le  Passage,  we  always  leave  the  waiter  a
very generous gratuity. 

Gratuity is a fancier and more formal word than tip. It occurs most often in written notices along the
lines of “Gratuities accepted.” Its formality makes it best suited for describing tips of the dignified,
expensive variety. For the taxi driver who takes you to the superb Belgian restaurant, it's a tip; for the
restaurant's maitre d', it's a gratuity.

- [[gratuitous]] 

 Not called for by the circumstances. 

• Members of the committee were objecting to what they considered gratuitous violence on television.

In its original sense, gratuitous can refer to anything given freely, like a tip. But the word now almost
always  applies  to  something  that's  seen  as  not  only  unnecessary  (like  a  tip,  which  you  don't  really
have  to  give)  but  also  unwelcome.  To  insult  or  criticize  someone  gratuitously  is  to  make  a  hurtful
remark that's uncalled for and undeserved. But scenes in a film that you yourself might call gratuitous
were, unfortunately, probably put there to attract an audience that wants to see them.

- [[ingratiate]] 

 To gain favor or acceptance by making a deliberate effort. 

• None of her attempts to ingratiate herself with the professor seemed to improve her grades. 

To  ingratiate  yourself  is  to  put  yourself  in  someone's  good  graces—that  is,  to  gain  someone's
approval. People often try to ingratiate themselves by engaging in an activity known by such names as
bootlicking,  apple-polishing,  and  brownnosing.  But  some  people  are  able  to  win  favor  just  by
relying on their ingratiating smiles.
