- POT  comes  from  the  Latin  adjective  potens,  meaning  “able.”  Our  English  word  potent  means
“powerful”  or  “effective,”  whether  for  good  or  bad.  A  potent  new  antibiotic  might  be  able  to  deal
with infections that have developed resistance to older drugs; an industrial gas might be identified as
a potent contributor to climate change; and a potent drink might leave you staggering.

- [[potential]] 
hope. 

 (1) The possibility that something will happen in the future. (2) A cause for

• If the plan works we'll be millionaires, but the potential for disaster is high. 

Potential can be either good or bad. Studying hard increases the potential for success, but wet roads
increase  the  potential  for  accidents.  But  when  a  person  or  thing  “has  potential,”  we  always  expect
something good from it in the future. As an adjective (as in “potential losses,” “potential benefits,”
etc.), potential  usually  means  simply  “possible.”  In  science,  however,  the  adjective  has  a  special
meaning: Potential energy is the kind of stored energy that a boulder sitting at the top of a cliff has
(the opposite of kinetic energy, which is what it has as it rolls down that cliff).

- [[impotent]] 

 Lacking power or strength. 

• The government now knows it's utterly impotent to stop the violence raging in the countryside, and
has basically retreated to the capital city. 

A  police  department  may  be  impotent  to  stop  the  flow  of  drugs  into  a  neighborhood.  A  group  of
countries  may  be  impotent  to  force  another  country  to  change  its  human-rights  policies.  The
impotence of a prime minister may be shown by her inability to get an important piece of legislation
passed.  Impotent  and  impotence  may  also  have  a  special  meaning,  when  they  refer  to  a  man's
inability to have sexual intercourse.

- [[plenipotentiary]] 
to do business for a government. 

 A person, such as a diplomat, who has complete power

• In the Great Hall, in the presence of the Empress, the plenipotentiaries of four European nations put
their signatures on the treaty. 

Back  in  the  12th  century,  when  the  Roman  Catholic  Church  in  some  ways  resembled  the  powerful
Roman  empire  that  had  come  before  it,  the  Church  revived  the  Roman  concept  of  an  official  with
plena  potens—“full  powers”—to  negotiate  agreements  (see  PLE/PLEN).  Whereas  an  ambassador
could  only  make  offers  that  a  faraway  ruler  had  specified,  often  weeks  or  months  earlier,  a
plenipotentiary could negotiate an entire agreement without checking back constantly with his ruler.
Today, with instant electronic communications, this distinction has generally lost its importance, but
there are still ambassadors who wouldn't be allowed at a negotiating table.

- [[potentate]] 

 A powerful ruler. 

• After 18 years as president of the college, he wielded power like a medieval potentate, and no one
on the faculty or staff dared to challenge him. 

Like such titles as grand vizier, caliph, and khan, potentate summons up thoughts of absolute rulers
of an earlier age in such lands as Turkey, Persia, and India. It often suggests a person who uses power
or authority in a cruel and unjust way—that is, a tyrant. Today, though it's still used as a title by the
organization called the Shriners, it's more often used humorously (“Supreme Intergalactic Potentate,”
“Potentate of Pasta,” etc.).

- Greek and Latin Borrowings

ambrosia 
pleasant to taste or smell. 

  (1)  The  food  of  the  Greek  and  Roman  gods.  (2)  Something  extremely

• After two days lost in the woods, the simple stew tasted like ambrosia to them. 

Ambrosia  literally  means  “immortality”  in  Greek,  and  in  Greek  and  Roman  mythology  only  the
immortals—the gods and goddesses—could eat ambrosia or drink nectar. Both may have been divine
forms  of  honey.  The  gods  also  used  nectar  and  ambrosia  like  oils  for  ceremonial  anointing,  and  a
mixture of water, oil, and fruits called ambrosia came to be used in human ceremonies as well. Since
we can't know what the mythical ambrosia tasted or smelled like, we mere mortals are free to give
the  name  to  our  favorite  ambrosial  dessert—perhaps  one  involving  oranges,  coconut,  and  heavy
cream.

- [[dogma]] 
of principles taught by a religious organization. 

 (1) Something treated as established and accepted opinion. (2) A principle or set

• New findings about how animals communicate are challenging the current dogma in the field. 

Religious  dogma  and  scientific  dogma  are  sometimes  at  odds,  as  in  arguments  between  those  who
believe in the biblical story of creation and those who believe in evolution. Since all dogma resists
change, arguments of any kind are harder to resolve when both sides are dogmatic in their beliefs.
Dogma  and  dogmatic  are  generally  used  disapprovingly;  it's  always  other  people  who  believe
unquestioningly in dogma and who take a dogmatic approach to important issues.

- [[gratis]] 

 Without charge; free. 

• The service is gratis, since it comes as part of a package deal. 

Gratis comes from the Latin word for “favor”; so in English a party favor is a small item given gratis
to everyone attending a party. Gratis is used as both an adjective (“The drinks were gratis”) and an
adverb (“Drinks were served gratis”). But however it's used, it means “free.”

- [[eureka]] 

 An exclamation used to express triumph and delight on a discovery. 

• The mountain town of Eureka, California, was named for the cries of delight by prospectors when
they discovered gold in them thar hills. 

Eureka means “I have found” in Greek. The story goes that the Greek inventor Archimedes, given the
task of determining the purity of gold in a crown, shouted “Eureka!” one day after stepping into a bath
and making water slop over the side, when he suddenly realized that the weight of water displaced
indicated the bulk of his body, but that a larger body made of lighter matter might weigh the same but
would displace more water. Thus, a crown in which lighter metal had secretly been mixed with the
gold  would  reveal  itself  in  the  same  way.  The  story  may  not  be  true,  but  we  still  shout  “Eureka!”
when we make a sudden, welcome discovery.

- [[per]] se 

   By, of, or in itself; as such. 

•  He  claims  that  the  reason  for  the  invasion  wasn't  oil  per  se,  but  rather  the  country's  dangerous
military power, which had been made possible by its oil. 

We generally use per se to distinguish between something in its narrow sense and some larger thing
that it represents. Thus, you may have no objection to educational testing per se, but rather to the way
testing is done. An opposition party may attack a president's policy not because they dislike the policy
per se but because they want to weaken the president. And when New York's police chief decided to
crack  down  on  small  crimes,  it  wasn't  the  small  crimes  per  se  that  were  his  target,  but  instead  the
larger crimes which he believed would be reduced because of this new approach.

- [[opus]] 
order of publication. 

 A creative work, especially a musical composition or set of compositions numbered in

• Beethoven's Ninth Symphony is also known as Opus (Op.) 125. 

A  literary  opus  is  often  a  single  novel,  though  the  word  may  sometimes  refer  to  all  of  a  writer's
works.  But  opus  normally  is  used  for  musical  works.  Mendelssohn's  Opus  90  is  his  Italian
Symphony, for example, and Brahms's Op. 77 is his Violin Concerto. Since many composers' works
were never given opus numbers in an orderly way, they now often have catalog numbers assigned by
later scholars. So Haydn's Symphony No. 104 is Hob.104 (Hob. is short for Anthony van Hoboken,
the cataloger), and Mozart's Marriage of Figaro is K.492 (K. stands for Ludwig Köchel).

- [[impetus]] 
hard; incentive. (2) Momentum. 

  (1)  A  driving  force  or  impulse;  something  that  makes  a  person  try  or  work

• The promise of a nice bonus gave us all an added impetus for finishing the project on time. 

An  impetus  can  be  something  positive  and  pleasant,  or  something  negative  and  unpleasant,  but  in
either case it stimulates action. The need to earn a living provides many people with the impetus to
drag  themselves  out  of  bed  five  mornings  a  week.  On  the  other  two  days,  the  impetus  might  be  the
smell  of  bacon  cooking,  or  the  idea  of  an  early-morning  round  of  golf.  Impetus  can  be  used  either
with an or the in front of it (“The accident provided an impetus for changing the safety regulations”)
or without them (“His discoveries have given impetus to further research”).

- [[thesis]] 
  (1)  An  opinion  or  proposition  that  a  person  presents  and  tries  to  prove  by
argument. (2) An extended paper that contains the results of original research, especially one written
by a candidate for an academic degree. 

• She's done all the coursework needed for her master's degree but hasn't yet completed her thesis. 

In high school, college, or graduate school, students often have to write a thesis on a topic in their
major  field  of  study.  In  many  fields,  a  final  thesis  is  the  biggest  challenge  involved  in  getting  a
master's degree, and the same is true for students studying for a Ph.D. (a Ph.D. thesis is often called a
dissertation). But a thesis may also be an idea; so in the course of the paper the student may put forth
several theses (notice the plural form) and attempt to prove them.
