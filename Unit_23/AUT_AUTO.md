- AUT/AUTO  comes  from  the  Greek  word  for  “same”  or  “self.”  Something  automatic  operates  by
itself,  and  an  automobile  moves  by  itself,  without  the  help  of  a  horse.  An  autograph  is  in  the
handwriting  of  the  person  him-  or  herself,  and  an  autopsy  is  an  inspection  of  a  corpse  by  an
examiner's own eyes.

• The work he used to do as a welder in the assembly plant has been taken over by a sophisticated
automaton designed overseas. 

The idea of the automaton has fascinated people for many centuries. A traveler to the emperor's court
in Byzantium in A.D. 949 reported that mechanical birds sat in a golden tree singing the songs of their
species; that mechanical lions flanked the throne, roaring and switching their great tails; and that, as
he stood watching, the emperor's throne suddenly shot upward toward the high ceiling, and when it
slowly  descended  the  emperor  was  wearing  new  robes.  Early  automata  (notice  the  common  plural
form)  often  relied  on  water,  steam,  or  falling  weights  to  power  them.  Today  automata,  often  called
robots, are used in manufacturing plants to build not only vehicles but also much smaller electronic
equipment.

• His doctors suspected that the strange combination of symptoms might be those of an autoimmune
disease. 

Any healthy body produces a variety of antibodies, proteins in the blood whose job is to protect the
body  from  unwanted  bacteria,  viruses,  and  cancer  cells.  The  cells  and  organs  that  deal  with  such
infections  make  up  the  immune  system.  In  some  people  and  animals,  for  various  reasons,  the
antibodies  become  overactive  and  turn  on  the  body's  healthy  tissues  as  well;  the  result  is  an
autoimmune  disease—an  immune  response  directed  against  one's  own  self.  More  than  eighty
autoimmune diseases have been identified, the best-known being type 1 diabetes, multiple sclerosis,
lupus, and rheumatoid arthritis.

especially moral independence. 

  (1)  The  power  or  right  of  self-government.  (2)  Self-directing  freedom,

• Though normally respectful of their son's autonomy, the Slocums drew the line at his request to take
a cross-country motorcycle trip. 

Since  nomos  is  Greek  for  “law,”  something  autonomous  makes  its  own  laws.  The  amount  of
autonomy  enjoyed  by  French-speaking  Quebec,  or  of  Palestinians  in  certain  towns  in  Israel,  or  of
independent-minded regions of Russia, have become major issues. The autonomy of individual states
in  the  United  States  has  posed  serious  constitutional  questions  for  two  centuries.  The  autonomy  of
children  is  almost  always  limited  by  their  parents.  But  when  those  parents  are  elderly  and  begin
driving poorly and getting confused about their finances, their children may see the need to limit their
autonomy in much the same way.

- [[autism]] 
\   A  condition  that  begins  in  childhood  and  causes  problems  in  forming  social
relationships and in communicating with others and includes behavior in which certain activities are
constantly repeated. 

• She was beginning to think that her four-year-old's strange behavior and complete lack of interest in
his playmates might be due to autism. 

Autism, in its strict sense, becomes evident before the age of 3. The autistic child generally refuses to
talk,  becomes  obsessive  about  toys,  resists  any  change  vehemently,  and  sometimes  flies  into
unexplained rages. Autism is believed to be biological in origin, and seems to be related to several
milder conditions such as Asperger's syndrome. As many as 1 in 100 children, mostly boys, may have
autism,  Asperger's,  or  a  related  condition.  About  one  in  ten  autistic  children  turns  out  to  have  a
remarkable mental gift, such as the ability to play a difficult piece on the piano after a single hearing
or repair a complex machine without any training. Many autistic children seem to grow out of it as
they become adults, and some autistic adults manage to live independently. Autistic is sometimes used
loosely to describe a much more common kind of psychological withdrawal in adults.
