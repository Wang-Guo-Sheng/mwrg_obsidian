- CRAC/CRAT comes from the Greek word meaning “power.” Attached to another root, it indicates
which group holds the power. With demos, the Greek word for “people,” it forms democracy, a form
of  government  in  which  the  people  rule.  A  theocracy,  from  the  Greek  theos,  “god,”  is  government
based on divine guidance. In a meritocracy, people earn power by their own merit.

- [[aristocrat]] 

 The highest social class in a country, usually because of birth and wealth.

•  A  wealthy  aristocrat  from  a  famous  European  family,  she  surprised  everyone  by  becoming  a
supporter of little-known jazz musicians. 

Since  aristos  means  “best”  in  Greek,  ancient  Greeks  such  as  Plato  and  Aristotle  used  the  word
aristocracy to mean a system of rule by the best people—that is, those who deserved to rule because
of their intelligence and moral excellence. But this kind of “best” soon became something you could
inherit from your parents. The United States has no formal aristocracy—no noble titles such as baron
or  marquis  that  stay  in  the  family—but  certain  American  families  have  achieved  an  almost
aristocratic status because of the wealth they've held onto for generations.

- [[autocratic]] 
(2) Resembling the ruler of such a government. 

 (1) Having to do with a form of government in which one person rules.

• It's hard to believe that a guy who seems so nice to his friends is an autocratic boss who sometimes
fires people just because he's in a bad mood. 

Autos in Greek means “same” or “self,” so in an autocratic government all the power is held by the
leader  him-  or  herself.  Autocratic  governments  are  often  called  dictatorships,  or  sometimes
autocracies. In everyday life, a teacher, a parent, or a football coach can all behave like autocrats as
well.

- [[bureaucrat]] 
system that is marked by fixed and complex rules that often result in long delays. 

 (1) An appointed government official. (2) An official of a government or

• To settle his insurance claim he had to make his way through four or five bureaucrats, every one of
them with a new form to fill out. 

In  French,  a  bureau  is  a  desk,  so  bureaucracy  means  basically  “government  by  people  at  desks.”
Despite the bad-mouthing they often get, partly because they usually have to stick so close to the rules,
bureaucrats  do  almost  all  the  day-to-day  work  that  keeps  a  government  running.  The  idea  of  a
bureaucracy is to split up the complicated task of governing a large country into smaller jobs that can
be  handled  by  specialists.  Bureaucratic  government  is  nothing  new;  the  Roman  empire  had  an
enormous  and  complex  bureaucracy,  with  the  bureaucrats  at  lower  levels  reporting  to  bureaucrats
above them, and so on up to the emperor himself.

- [[plutocracy]] 
people. 

  (1)  Government  by  the  wealthy.  (2)  A  controlling  class  of  wealthy

• Theodore Roosevelt sought to limit the power held by the plutocracy of wealthy industrialists. 

Ploutos was Greek for “wealth,” and Plouton, or Pluto, was one of the names used for the Greek god
of  the  underworld,  where  all  the  earth's  mineral  wealth  was  stored.  So  a  plutocracy  governs  or
wields power through its money. The economic growth in the U.S. in the late 19th century produced a
group  of  enormously  wealthy  plutocrats.  Huge  companies  like  John  D.  Rockefeller's  Standard  Oil
gained serious political power, and Rockefeller was able to influence lawmakers in states where his
businesses  operated.  For  this  reason,  it  was  said  in  1905  that  Ohio  and  New  Jersey  were
plutocracies, not democracies.
