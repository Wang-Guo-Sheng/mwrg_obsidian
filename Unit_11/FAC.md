- FAC comes from the Latin verb facere, meaning “to make or do.” Thus, a fact was originally simply
“something done.” A benefactor is someone who does good. And to manufacture is to make, usually
in a factory.

- [[factor]] 

 Something that contributes to producing a result: ingredient. 

•  The  most  important  factor  in  the  success  of  the  treaty  talks  was  the  physical  presence  of  the  two
presidents. 

In Latin factor means simply “doer.” So in English a factor is an “actor” or element or ingredient in
some situation or quantity. Charm can be a factor in someone's success, and lack of exercise can be a
factor in producing a poor physique. In math we use factor to mean a number that can be multiplied or
divided to produce a given number (for example, 5 and 8 are factors of 40). And in biology a gene
may be called a factor, since genes are ingredients in the total organism.

- [[factotum]] 

 A person whose job involves doing many different kinds of work. 

• Over the years she had become the office factotum, who might be doing legal research one day and
organizing the company picnic the next. 

This  odd  word  doesn't  come  from  ancient  Latin,  but  it  was  coined  to  look  as  if  it  did.  The  term
Johannes factotum, meaning “Jack-of-all-trades,” first shows up in writing in 1592 to describe none
other  than  Shakespeare  himself.  The  word  gofer  is  similar  to  factotum  but  a  bit  less  dignified.  In
other  words,  a  factotum  is  an  assistant,  but  one  who  may  have  taken  over  some  fairly  important
functions.

- [[facile]] 

 (1) Easily accomplished. (2) Shallow, superficial. 

• The principal made a facile argument for the school's policy, but no one was convinced. 

A  facile  suggestion  doesn't  deal  with  the  issue  in  any  depth,  and  a  facile  solution  may  be  only
temporarily effective. A facile writer is one who seems to write too quickly and easily, and a careful
reader may discover that the writer hasn't really said very much.

- [[facilitate]] 

 To make (something) easier; to make (something) run more smoothly. 

• Her uncle hadn't exactly gotten her the job, but he had certainly facilitated the process. 

Facilitating is about getting things done. Clever employees are quietly facilitating all kinds of useful
activity  within  their  organizations  all  the  time.  People  who  lead  therapy  groups  or  workshops  are
often called facilitators, since their job isn't to teach or to order but rather to make the meetings as
productive as possible. Even businesses now use facilitators in meetings where they don't want any
person's  particular  desires  to  outweigh  anyone  else's.  The  facilitation  of  a  rewarding  discussion
should be a facilitator's only goal. Today, in recognition of the many different situations that may call
for a facilitator, there is even an International Association of Facilitators.

- LUM comes from the Latin noun lumen, meaning “light.” Thus, our word illuminate means “to supply
