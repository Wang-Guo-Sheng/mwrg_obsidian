- TURB comes from the Latin verb turbare,  “to  throw  into  confusion  or  upset,”  and  the  noun  turba,
“crowd” or “confusion.” So a disturbance, for example, confuses and upsets normal order or routine.

• The mood of the crowd was restless and turbid, and any spark could have turned them into a mob. 

The Colorado River in spring, swollen by melting snow from the high mountains, races through the
Grand Canyon, turbid and churning. A chemical solution may be described as turbid rather than clear.
And your emotions may be turbid as well, especially where love is involved: What did he mean by
that glance? Why did she say it like that?

- [[perturb]] 

 To upset, confuse, or disarrange. 

• News of the new peace accord was enough to perturb some radical opponents of any settlements. 

With its per- [[prefix]], perturb meant originally “thoroughly upset,” though today the word has lost most
of its intense edge. Perturb and perturbation are often used by scientists, usually when speaking of a
change  in  their  data  indicating  that  something  has  affected  some  normal  process.  When  someone  is
referred  to  as  imperturbable,  it  means  he  or  she  manages  to  remain  calm  through  the  most  trying
experiences.

- [[turbine]] 
water, steam, or air under pressure. 

  A  rotary  engine  with  blades  made  to  turn  and  generate  power  by  a  current  of

• The power plant used huge turbines powered by water going over the dam to generate electricity. 

The oldest and simplest form of turbine is the waterwheel, which is made to rotate by water falling
across its blades and into buckets suspended from them. Hero of Alexandria invented the first steam-
driven turbine in the 1st century A.D., but a commercially practical steam turbine wasn't developed
until 1884; steam turbines are now the main elements of electric power stations. Jet engines are gas
turbines. A turbojet engine uses a turbine to compress the incoming air that feeds the engine before
being ejected to push the plane forward; a turboprop engine uses its exhaust to drive a turbine that
spins a propeller. A wind turbine generates electricity by being turned by the wind; the largest now
have vanes with a turning diameter of over 400 feet.

- [[turbulent]] 

 (1) Stirred up, agitated. (2) Stirring up unrest, violence, or disturbance. 

• The huge ocean liner Queen Elizabeth II was never much troubled by turbulent seas that might have
sunk smaller boats. 

Some people lead turbulent lives, and some are constantly in the grip of turbulent emotions. The late
1960s  are  remembered  as  turbulent  years  of  social  revolution  in  America  and  Europe.  Often  the
captain of an airplane will warn passengers to fasten their seatbelts because of upper-air turbulence,
which can make for a bumpy ride. El Niño, a seasonal current of warm water in the Pacific Ocean,
may  create  turbulence  in  the  winds  across  the  United  States,  affecting  patterns  of  rainfall  and
temperature as well.

- VOLU/VOLV  comes  from  the  Latin  verb  volvere,  meaning  “to  roll,  wind,  turn  around,  or  twist
