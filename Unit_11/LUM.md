- LUM comes from the Latin noun lumen, meaning “light.” Thus, our word illuminate means “to supply
with light” or “make clear,” and illumination is light that shines on something.

- [[lumen]] 

 In physics, the standard unit for measuring the rate of the flow of light. 

• The lumen is a measure of the perceived power of light. 

There are two common units for measuring light, the candela and the lumen. Both are recognized as
standard international units, which also include the second (for time), the kilogram (for weight), and
the meter (for length). The candela is a measure of intensity; an ordinary candle gives off light with
the intensity of about one candela. The lumen is a measure of “luminous flux”; a standard 100-watt
lightbulb gives off 1500–1700 lumens. Luminous flux indicates how much light is actually perceived
by the human eye. Technologies vary in how efficiently they turn electricity into light; halogen lights
produce  about  12  lumens  per  watt,  ordinary  incandescent  lightbulbs  produce  about  15  lumens  per
watt, and compact fluorescent bulbs produce about 50 lumens per watt.

- [[luminous]] 

 (1) Producing or seeming to produce light. (2) Filled with light. 

• She ended her recital with a luminous performance of Ravel's song cycle, and the crowd called her
back for repeated encores. 

Luminous,  like  its  synonyms  radiant,  shining,  glowing,  and  lustrous,  is  generally  a  positive
adjective,  especially  when  it  describes  something  that  doesn't  literally  glow,  such  as  a  face,  a
performance,  or  a  poem.  Luminous  signs  depend  on  a  gas  such  as  neon,  krypton,  argon,  xenon,  or
radon—and  you  can  use  luminous  (DayGlo)  paint  to  make  your  own  signs.  New  technologies  have
now given us luminous fabrics, which are being used to produce striking or creepy effects in clothing,
upholstery, and interior surfaces.

- [[bioluminescent]] 

 Relating to light given off by living organisms. 

• Most of the light emitted by bioluminescent marine organisms is blue or blue-green. 

Bio- [[comes]] from the Greek word for “life” (see BIO). On land, fireflies, glowworms, and the fox-fire
fungus  are  all  known  for  their  bioluminescence.  In  the  sea,  bioluminescent  life-forms  include
plankton,  squid,  and  comb  jellies,  as  well  as  some  unusual  fish.  Most  deep-sea  animals  are
bioluminescent,  but  single-celled  algae  living  at  or  near  the  surface  can  also  create  a  remarkable
show,  as  they  often  do  in  Bioluminescent  Bay  on  the  Puerto  Rican  island  of  Vieques.  But
bioluminescence is unknown in true plants, and mammals, birds, reptiles, and amphibians never got
the knack of it either.

- [[luminary]] 

 A very famous or distinguished person. 

• Entering the glittering reception room, she immediately spotted several luminaries of the art world. 

The  Latin  word  luminaria  could  mean  either  “lamps”  or  “heavenly  bodies.”  For  medieval
astrologers, the luminaries were the sun and the moon, the brightest objects in the heavens. Today a
luminary is usually a person of “brilliant” achievement: a celebrity, a “leading light,” or a “star.”

- Words from Mythology and History

muse 

 A source of inspiration; a guiding spirit. 

•  At  8:00  each  morning  he  sat  down  at  his  desk  and  summoned  his  muse,  and  she  almost  always
responded. 

The  Muses  were  the  nine  Greek  goddesses  who  presided  over  the  arts  (including  music)  and
literature. A shrine to the Muses was called in Latin a museum. An artist or poet about to begin work
would call on his particular Muse to inspire him, and a poem itself might begin with such a call; thus,
Homer's Odyssey begins, “Sing to me of the man, Muse” (that is, of Odysseus). Today a muse may be
one's  special  creative  spirit,  but  some  artists  and  writers  have  also  chosen  living  human  beings  to
serve as their muses.

- [[iridescent]] 
light shifts. 

 Having a glowing, rainbowlike play of color that seems to change as the

• The children shrieked with glee as the iridescent soap bubbles floated away in the gentle breeze. 

Iris, the Greek goddess of the rainbow, took messages from Mount Olympus to earth, and from gods to
mortals  or  other  gods,  using  the  rainbow  as  her  stairway.  Iridescence  is  thus  the  glowing,  shifting,
colorful quality of a rainbow, also seen in an opal, a light oil slick, a butterfly wing, or the mother-of-
pearl that lines an oyster shell.

- [[mausoleum]] 
the dead. (2) A large, gloomy building or room. 

 (1) A large tomb, especially one built aboveground with shelves for

• The family's grand mausoleum occupied a prominent spot in the cemetery, for all the good it did the
silent dead within. 

Mausolus  was  ruler  of  a  kingdom  in  Asia  Minor  in  the  4th  century  B.C.  He  beautified  the  capital,
Halicarnassus,  with  all  sorts  of  fine  public  buildings,  but  he  is  best  known  for  the  magnificent
monument, the Mausoleum, that was built by his wife Artemisia after his death. With its great height
(perhaps  140  feet)  and  many  beautiful  sculptures,  the  Mausoleum  was  declared  one  of  the  Seven
Wonders of the Ancient World. Though Halicarnassus was repeatedly attacked, the Mausoleum would
survive for well over 1,000 years.

- [[mentor]] 

 A trusted counselor, guide, tutor, or coach. 

•  This  pleasant  old  gentleman  had  served  as  friend  and  mentor  to  a  series  of  young  lawyers  in  the
firm. 

Odysseus was away from home fighting and journeying for 20 years, according to Homer. During that
time, the son he left as a babe in arms grew up under the supervision of Mentor, an old and trusted
friend. When the goddess Athena decided it was time to complete young Telemachus's education by
sending him off to learn about his father, she visited him disguised as Mentor and they set out together.
Today, anyone such as a coach or tutor who gives another (usually younger) person help and advice
on  how  to  achieve  success  in  the  larger  world  is  called  a  mentor.  And  in  recent  years  we've  even
been  using  the  word  as  a  verb,  and  now  in  business  we  often  speak  of  an  experienced  employee
mentoring someone who has just arrived.

- [[narcissism]] 
desire for one's own body. 

 (1) Extreme self-centeredness or fascination with oneself. (2) Love or

• His girlfriend would complain about his narcissism, saying he spent more time looking at himself in
the mirror than at her. 

Narcissus was a handsome youth in Greek mythology who inspired love in many who saw him. One
was the nymph Echo, who could only repeat the last thing that anyone said. When Narcissus cruelly
rejected  her,  she  wasted  away  to  nothing  but  her  voice.  Though  he  played  with  the  affections  of
others,  Narcissus  became  a  victim  of  his  own  attractiveness.  When  he  caught  sight  of  his  own
reflection in a pool, he sat gazing at it in fascination, wasting away without food or drink, unable to
touch or kiss the image he saw. When he finally died, the gods turned him into the flower we call the
narcissus, which stands with its head bent as though gazing at its reflection. People with “narcissistic
personality disorder” have a somewhat serious mental condition, according to psychologists, but the
rest of us are free to call anyone who seems vain and self-centered a narcissist.

- [[tantalize]] 
reach. 

  To  tease  or  torment  by  offering  something  desirable  but  keeping  it  out  of

• The sight of a warm fire through the window tantalized the little match girl almost unbearably. 

King Tantalus, according to Greek mythology, killed his son Pelops and served him to the gods in a
stew for dinner. Almost all the gods realized what was happening and refused the meal, though only
after Demeter had taken a nibble out of Pelops's shoulder. After they had reconstructed him, replacing
the missing shoulder with a piece of ivory, they turned to punishing Tantalus. In Hades he stands in
water up to his neck under a tree laden with fruit. Each time he stoops to drink, the water moves out
of reach; each time he reaches up to pick something, the branches move beyond his grasp. He is thus
eternally tantalized by the water and fruit. Today anything or anyone that tempts but is unobtainable is
tantalizing.

- [[thespian]] 

 An actor. 

• In summer the towns of New England welcome troupes of thespians dedicated to presenting plays of
all kinds. 

Greek  drama  was  originally  entirely  performed  by  choruses.  According  to  tradition,  the  Greek
dramatist Thespis, of the 6th century B.C., was the inventor of tragedy and the first to write roles for
the individual actor as distinct from the chorus, and the actor's exchanges with the chorus were the
first  dramatic  dialogue.  Since  Thespis  himself  performed  the  individual  parts  in  his  own  plays,  he
was also the first true actor. Ever since choruses disappeared from drama, thespians have filled all
the  roles  in  plays.  Thespian  is  also  an  adjective;  thus,  we  can  speak  of  “thespian  ambitions”  and
“thespian traditions,” for example.

- [[zephyr]] 

 (1) A breeze from the west. (2) A gentle breeze. 

• Columbus left Genoa sailing against the zephyrs that continually blow across the Mediterranean. 

The ancient Greeks called the west wind Zephyrus and regarded him and his fellows—Boreas (god
of  the  north  wind),  Eurus  (god  of  the  east  wind),  and  Notus  (god  of  the  south  wind)—as  gods.  A
zephyr is a kind wind, bringer of clear skies and beautiful weather.
