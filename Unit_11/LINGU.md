- LINGU comes from the Latin word that means both “tongue” and “language,” and in English today
tongue can still mean “language” (as in “her native tongue”). Our expression “slip of the tongue” is
just  a  translation  of  the  Latin  phrase  lapsus linguae.  The  root  even  shows  up  in  a  slangy-sounding
word like lingo. And since lingu- [[changed]] to langu- in French, our word language is related as well.

- [[linguistics]] 

 The study of human speech. 

•  The  new  speechwriter,  who  had  majored  in  linguistics,  was  soon  putting  his  knowledge  of  the
deceptive tricks of language to good use. 

Any analysis of language, including 8th-grade grammar, can be called linguistics. As recently as 200
years ago, ordinary grammar was about the only kind of linguistics there was. Today a linguist may
be  a  person  who  learns  foreign  languages,  but  the  term  usually  refers  to  people  who  devote
themselves  to  analyzing  the  structure  of  language.  Many  linguists  concentrate  on  the  history  of  a
language; others study the way children learn to speak; others analyze the sounds of a language—and
still others just study English grammar, a subject so big that you could easily spend your entire life on
it.

- [[multilingual]] 

 Using or able to use several languages. 

• She soon discovered that he was truly multilingual, fluent in not only the German and Polish he had
grown up speaking but in English and Arabic as well. 

The  roots  of  multilingual  come  from  Latin  (see  MULTI).  If  you  happen  to  prefer  Greek,  use  the
synonym polyglot, in which poly- [[has]] the same meaning as multi-, and -glot means the same thing as -
lingual. The best way to become multilingual is probably to be born in a bilingual (two-language)
household;  learning  those  first  two  seems  to  give  the  mind  the  kind  of  exercise  that  makes  later
language-learning easy.

- [[lingua]]  franca 
peoples who speak different languages. 

  A  language  used  as  a  common  or  commercial  language  among

• That first evening in Tokyo, she heard English being spoken at the next table, and realized it was
serving as a lingua franca for a party of Korean and Japanese businessmen. 

In the Middle Ages, the Arabs of the eastern Mediterranean referred to all Europeans as Franks (the
name  of  the  tribe  that  once  occupied  the  land  we  call  France).  Since  there  was  plenty  of  Arab-
European  trade,  the  traders  in  the  Mediterranean  ports  eventually  developed  a  trading  language
combining  Italian,  Arabic,  and  other  languages,  which  almost  everyone  could  more  or  less
understand,  and  it  became  known  as  the  “Frankish  language,”  or  lingua  franca.  Some  languages
actually  succeed  in  becoming  lingua  francas  without  changing  much.  So,  when  the  Roman  empire
became vast and mighty, Latin became the important lingua franca; and at a meeting between Japanese
and Vietnamese businesspeople today, English may well be the only language spoken.

- [[linguine]] 

 A narrow, flat pasta. 

• As a test of her clients' table manners, she would serve them challenging dishes and watch to see
how gracefully they could handle chopsticks or deal with long, slithery linguine. 

The modern language closest to Latin is Italian, and the Italian word linguine means literally “little
tongues.”  Linguine  is  only  one  of  the  types  of  pasta  whose  names  describes  their  shapes.  Others
include  spaghetti  (“little  strings”),  fettuccine  (“little  ribbons”),  penne  (“little  quills”),  orzo
(“barley”),  farfalle  (“butterflies”),  vermicelli  (“little  worms”),  capellini  (“little  hairs”),  fusilli
(“little  spindles”),  and  radiatori  (“little  radiators”).  If  you're  thinking  about  learning  Italian,  you
could make a good start by just visiting an Italian restaurant.
