- VOLU/VOLV  comes  from  the  Latin  verb  volvere,  meaning  “to  roll,  wind,  turn  around,  or  twist
around.” Thus, revolve simply means “turn in circles.” And a volume was originally a scroll or roll
of papyrus.

- [[voluble]] 

 Speaking readily and rapidly; talkative. 

• He proved to be a voluble informer who would tell stories of bookies, smugglers, and hit men to the
detectives for hours. 

A voluble person has words “rolling” off his or her tongue. In O. Henry's famous story “The Ransom
of  Red  Chief,”  the  kidnappers  nab  a  boy  who  turns  out  to  be  so  unbearably  voluble  that  they  can
hardly wait to turn him loose again.

- [[devolve]] 
  ((1)  To  pass  (responsibility,  power,  etc.)  from  one  person  or  group  to  another
person or group at a lower level of authority. (2) To gradually go from an advanced state to a less
advanced state. 

• Since 1998, considerable power has been devolving from the British government in London to the
new Scottish Parliament in Edinburgh. 

With  its  de-  prefix  (see  DE),  devolution  implies  moving  backward.  Once  powers  have  been
centralized  in  a  unified  government,  giving  any  powers  back—that  is,  devolving  the  power—to  a
smaller  governmental  unit  can  seem  to  be  reversing  a  natural  development.  In  a  somewhat  similar
way, a job that your boss doesn't want to do may devolve upon you. But devolve and devolution are
also  treated  nowadays  as  the  opposites  of  evolve  and  evolution.  So  we  may  also  speak  of  moral
devolution, such as occurred in Germany in the 1930s, when a country with an extraordinary culture
became a brutal dictatorship. And parents may watch their slacker teenager and wonder if devolution
is occurring right in front of their eyes.

- [[evolution]] 
higher, more complex, or better. 

 A process of change from a lower, simpler, or worse state to one that is

•  Thomas  Jefferson  and  the  other  Founding  Fathers  believed  that  political  evolution  reached  its
highest form in democracy. 

Part  of  the  humor  of  the  old  Flintstones  cartoon  show  is  that  it  contradicts  what  is  known  about
biological evolution, since humans actually evolved long after dinosaurs were extinct. Evolution can
also be used more broadly to refer to technology, society, and other human creations. For example, an
idea may evolve, even in your own mind, as the months or years pass. And though many people don't
believe  that  human  beings  truly  become  better  with  the  passing  centuries,  many  will  argue  that  our
societies tend to evolve, producing more goods and providing more protection for more people.

- [[convoluted]] 

 (1) Having a pattern of curved windings. (2) Involved, intricate. 

• After 10 minutes, Mr. Collins's strange story had become so convoluted that none of us could follow
it. 

Convolution originally meant a complex winding pattern such as those visible on the surface of the
brain. So a convoluted argument or a convoluted explanation is one that winds this way and that. An
official document may have to wind its way through a convoluted process and be stamped by eight
people  before  being  approved.  Convoluted  language  makes  many  people  suspicious;  as  a  great
philosopher once said, “Anything that can be said can be said clearly.”

- - [[a]].  process  of  development  b.  process  of  democracy  c.  process  of  election  d.  process  of
elimination
