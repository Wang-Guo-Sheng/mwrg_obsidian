- SPIR comes from the Latin words meaning “breath” and “breathe.” When we inspire others—that is,
give them inspiration—it's  as  though  we're  breathing  new  energy  and  imagination  into  them.  When
you expire,  or  die,  you  “breathe  out”  your  soul  in  your  last  breath.  A  license,  membership,  credit
card, or free offer may also expire, at a time indicated by its expiration date.

- [[spirited]] 

 Full of energy or courage; very lively or determined. 

• The team put up a spirited defense, but they were doomed from the start. 

You may see spirited used to describe a conversation, a debate, a horse, or a campaign. And it often
shows  up  in  such  words  as  high-spirited  (“bold  and  energetic”),  mean-spirited  (“spiteful”),  and
public-spirited  (“generous  to  a  community”),  all  of  which  reflect  the  original  meaning  of  spirit,  a
notion much like “soul” or “personality.”

- [[dispiriting]] 

 Causing a loss of hope or enthusiasm. 

• It was terribly dispiriting for them to lose yet another game, and he had to reassure his daughter that
she'd actually done a great job as goalie. 

Lots of things can be dispiriting: a bad job interview, an awful film, a relationship going sour. Maybe
for  that  reason,  dispiriting  has  lots  of  synonyms:  discouraging,  disheartening,  demoralizing,
depressing, etc.

- [[respirator]] 
substances from the air. (2) A device for maintaining artificial respiration. 

  (1)  A  device  worn  over  the  nose  and  mouth  to  filter  out  dangerous

•  His  lungs  had  been  terribly  damaged  by  decades  of  heavy  smoking,  and  he'd  been  living  on  a
respirator for the last year. 

Respiration means simply “breathing.” We usually come across the word in artificial respiration, the
lifesaving  technique  in  which  you  force  air  into  the  lungs  of  someone  who's  stopped  breathing.
Respirators  can  take  several  different  forms.  Scuba-diving  equipment  always  includes  a  respirator,
though  it  doesn't  actually  do  the  breathing  for  the  diver.  Medical  respirators,  which  are  used
especially for babies and for emergency care and actually take over the job of getting oxygen into the
lungs,  are  today  usually  called  ventilators,  so  as  to  distinguish  them  from  simple  oxygen  systems
(which merely provide a steady flow of oxygen into the nostrils) and face masks.

- [[transpire]] 

 (1) To happen. (2) To become known. 

•  We  kept  up  our  questioning,  and  it  soon  transpired  that  the  boys  had  known  about  the  murder  all
along . 

Since the prefix trans- [[means]] “through” (see TRANS), transpire's most literal meaning is something
like “breathe through.” Thus, the original meaning of the English word—still used today—is to give
off  a  watery  vapor  through  a  surface  such  as  a  leaf.  From  there,  it  came  to  mean  also  the  gradual
appearance  of  previously  secret  information,  as  if  leaking  out  of  the  pores  of  a  leaf  (as  in  “It
transpired that she was not only his employee but also his girlfriend”). And soon it was being used to
mean simply “happen” (as in “I wondered what had transpired in the cafeteria at lunchtime”).

- VER comes from the Latin word for “truth.” A verdict in a trial is “the truth spoken” (see DICT). But
