CANT, from the Latin verb cantare, meaning “sing,” produces several words that come directly from
Latin. But some others came to English by way of French, which added an h to the root, giving us such
words as chant and chantey.

- [[cantata]] 
century, for one or more voices accompanied by instruments. 

  A  musical  composition,  particularly  a  religious  work  from  the  17th  or  18th

•  Composers  of  the  18th  century  composed  sacred  cantatas  by  the  dozen,  and  Bach's  friend  G.  P.
Telemann actually wrote over a thousand. 

A cantata is sung, unlike a sonata, which is played on instruments only. The most famous cantatas are
by  Johann  Sebastian  Bach,  who  wrote  the  music  for  about  200  religious  cantatas,  using  hymns  and
new  religious  poems  as  his  texts.  His  cantatas  consisted  of  several  different  sections  for  different
voices—solos,  duets,  and  choruses.  Some  of  his  nonreligious  cantatas  have  been  performed  like
mini-operas.

• He repeated the words slowly over and over like an incantation. 

Incantation comes directly from the Latin word incantare, “enchant.” Incantare itself has cantare as
a root, which reminds us that magic and ritual have always been associated with chanting and music.
Incantations  have  often  been  in  strange  languages;  “Abracadabra”  is  a  not-so-serious  version  of  an
incantation.

and leads the congregation in prayer. 

 An official of a Jewish synagogue who sings or chants the music of the services

• The congregation waited for the cantor to begin the prayers before joining in. 

The cantor is, after the rabbi, the most important figure in a Jewish worship service. A cantor not only
must  possess  an  excellent  singing  voice  but  also  must  know  by  heart  long  passages  of  Hebrew.
Cantors such as Jan Peerce and Richard Tucker became international opera stars. The comedian and
singer Edward Israel Iskowitz renamed himself Eddie Cantor for his original profession and became
enormously popular on stage, screen, radio, and television for over 40 years.

- [[descant]] 

 An additional melody sung above the principal melody. 

• The soprano added a soaring descant to the final chorus that held the listeners spellbound. 

The prefix des-, meaning “two” or “apart,” indicates that the descant is a “second song” apart from
the main melody. In popular songs a descant will often be sung at the very end to produce a thrilling
climax.
