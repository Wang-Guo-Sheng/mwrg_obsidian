- VER comes from the Latin word for “truth.” A verdict in a trial is “the truth spoken” (see DICT). But
a just verdict may depend on the veracity, or “truthfulness,” of the witnesses.

- [[verify]] 

 (1) To prove to be true or correct. (2) To check or test the accuracy of. 

• It is the bank teller's job to verify the signature on a check. 

During talks between the United States and the former Soviet Union on nuclear weapons reduction,
one big problem was how to verify that weapons had been eliminated. Since neither side wanted the
other to know its secrets, verification of the facts became a difficult issue. Because of the distrust on
both sides, many doubted that the real numbers would ever be verifiable.

- [[aver]] 

 To state positively as true; declare. 

• The defendant averred that she was nowhere near the scene of the crime on the night in question. 

Since aver contains the “truth” root, it basically means “confirm as true.” You may aver anything that
you're sure of. In legal situations, aver means to state positively as a fact; thus, Perry Mason's clients
aver that they are innocent, while the district attorney avers the opposite. If you make such a statement
while under oath, and it turns out that you lied, you may have committed the crime of perjury.

- [[verisimilitude]] 
depiction of realism in art or literature. 

  (1)  The  appearance  of  being  true  or  probable.  (2)  The

•  By  the  beginning  of  the  20th  century,  the  leading  European  painters  were  losing  interest  in
verisimilitude and beginning to experiment with abstraction. 

From  its  roots,  verisimilitude  means  basically  “similarity  to  the  truth.”  Most  fiction  writers  and
filmmakers  aim  at  some  kind  of  verisimilitude  to  give  their  stories  an  air  of  reality.  They  need  not
show  something  actually  true,  or  even  very  common,  but  simply  something  believable.  A  mass  of
good  details  in  a  play,  novel,  painting,  or  film  may  add  verisimilitude.  A  spy  novel  without  some
verisimilitude won't interest many readers, but a fantastical novel may not even attempt to seem true
to life.

- [[veracity]] 

 (1) Truth or accuracy. (2) The quality of being truthful or honest. 

• We haven't been able to check the veracity of most of his story, but we know he wasn't at the motel
that night. 

People  often  claim  that  a  frog  placed  in  cold  water  that  then  is  gradually  heated  will  let  itself  be
boiled  to  death,  but  the  story  actually  lacks  veracity.  We  often  hear  that  the  Eskimo  (Inuit)  peoples
have  dozens  of  words  for  “snow,”  but  the  veracity  of  the  statement  is  doubtful,  since  Eskimo
languages  seem  to  have  no  more  snow  words  than  English  (with  flake,  blizzard,  powder,  drift,
freezing rain, etc.). In 2009 millions accepted the veracity of the claim that, against all the evidence,
the elected president wasn't a native-born American. Not all the “facts” we accept without thinking
are harmless.
