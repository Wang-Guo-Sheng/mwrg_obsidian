- GRAPH comes from the Greek verb graphein, “to write.” Thus, a biography is a written account of
someone's life (see BIO), a discography is a written list of recordings on disc (records or CDs), and
a filmography is a list of motion pictures. But lots of uses of -graph and -graphy don't mean literally
“writing”  (as  in  autograph  or  paragraph),  but  instead  something  more  like  “recording,”  as  in
photography, seismograph, or graph itself.

- [[calligraphy]] 

 The art of producing beautiful handwriting. 

• Calligraphy can be seen today in event invitations, logo designs, and stone inscriptions. 

Kalli- [[is]] a Greek root meaning “beautiful,” and “beautiful” in the case of calligraphy means artistic,
stylized, and elegant. Calligraphy has existed in many cultures, including Indian, Persian, and Islamic
cultures; Arabic puts a particularly high value on beautiful script, and in East Asia calligraphy has
long been considered a major art. Calligraphers in the West use pens with wide nibs, with which they
produce strokes of widely differing width within a single letter.

- [[hagiography]] 

 (1) Biography of saints. (2) Biography that idealizes or idolizes. 

•  According  to  the  new  biography,  which  should  really  be  called  a  hagiography,  the  former  prime
minister doesn't seem to have done anything small-minded or improper in his entire life. 

For those able to read, reading stories of the lives of the saints was a popular pastime for centuries,
and  books  collecting  short  saints'  biographies  were  best  sellers.  These  often  included  terrifically
colorful stories (about slaying dragons, magically traveling through space, etc.) that were perhaps a
bit  too  good  to  be  strictly  true,  and  after  finding  God  not  one  of  them  ever  did  a  single  thing  that
wasn't saintly—and some of them may not have actually existed. Still today, hagiographic accounts
of  the  lives  of  politicians  and  pop-culture  stars  are  being  written,  though  there  now  seems  to  be  a
bigger  audience  for  biographies  that  seek  out  the  not-so-wholesome  secrets  of  the  person's  life,
sometimes even making up a few of them.

- [[choreography]] 
them in symbolic notation. (2) The movements by dancers in a performance. 

 (1) The art of composing and arranging dances and of representing

• The reviews praised the show for its eye-catching choreography, calling it the best element of the
whole musical. 

In ancient Greece, a choreia was a circular dance accompanied by a singing chorus. But the actual
notating  of  dances  by  means  of  symbols  didn't  begin  until  the  17th  or  18th  century,  when  ballet
developed into a complex art form in France. The choreographer of a major ballet, which might run
to an hour or more, will always record his or her work in notation, though choreographing a five-
minute segment for a TV talent show usually doesn't require any record at all.

- [[lithograph]] 
prepared so that the ink will only stick to the design that will be printed. 

  A  picture  made  by  printing  from  a  flat  surface  (such  as  a  smooth  stone)

•  To  make  a  lithograph,  the  artist  first  draws  an  image,  in  reverse,  on  a  fine-grained  limestone  or
aluminum plate. 

Lithos is Greek for “stone,” and a stone surface has traditionally been involved in lithography, though
a metal plate may take its place today. The lithographic process was invented around 1796 and soon
became the main method of printing books and newspapers. Artists use lithography to produce prints
(works intended to be sold in many copies), and art lithographs sometimes resemble older types of
prints, including etchings, engravings, and woodcuts. Pablo Picasso, Marc Chagall, Joan Miró, and
M.  C.  Escher  are  among  the  many  artists  who  have  used  lithography  to  produce  important  original
works. Today lithographic printing accounts for over 40% of all printing, packaging, and publishing.

- ART comes from the Latin word for “skill.” This reminds us that, until a few centuries ago, almost no
