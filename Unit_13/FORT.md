- FORT comes from fortis, Latin for “strong.” The familiar noun fort, meaning a building strengthened
against  possible  attacks,  comes  directly  from  it.  And  our  verb  comfort  actually  means  “to  give
strength and hope to.”

- [[fortify]] 

 To strengthen. 

•  Fortified  by  a  good  night's  sleep  and  a  big  breakfast,  they  set  off  for  the  final  20  miles  of  their
journey. 

Medieval cities were fortified against attack by high walls, and volunteers may fortify a levee against
an overflowing river by means of sandbags. Foods can be fortified by adding vitamins, but “fortified
wines,” such as sherry and port, have brandy (a “stronger” drink) rather than vitamins added to them.
By  adopting  good  exercise  habits,  you  can  fortify  your  body  against  illness.  And  fortifying  needn't
always  be  physical.  An  author's  reputation  may  be  fortified  by  the  success  of  his  new  book,  or  a
prosecutor can fortify a case against a suspect by finding more evidence.

• The city's fortifications had withstood powerful assaults by catapults, battering rams, and tall siege
towers that rolled up to release soldiers onto the top of the walls. 

In  the  Middle  Ages,  many  European  cities  were  entirely  enclosed  by  sturdy  walls,  with  walkways
along the top and towers at intervals, designed to make an invasion impossible. A water-filled ditch,
or moat, might run alongside the wall for added defense. Such defenses turned the entire city into a
fort,  or  fortress.  Over  the  centuries,  fortifications  changed  steadily  with  the  development  of  new
weaponry. In World War II, the German fortification of the French coast included antitank barriers,
bunkers, minefields, and underwater obstacles, but it wasn't enough to turn back the immense force of
the Allied invasion on D-day.

- [[forte]] 

 

 

 Something that a person does particularly well; one's strong point. 

• Her forte was statistics, and she was always at a disadvantage when the discussion turned to public
policy. 

In the Middle Ages, swords were often known to break in battle, so the strongest part of a sword's
blade—the  part  between  the  handle  (or  hilt)  and  the  middle  of  the  blade—was  given  a  name,  the
forte. Today a forte is usually a special strength. But no one can agree on how to pronounce it: all
three  pronunciations  shown  above  are  heard  frequently.  Part  of  the  problem  is  confusion  with  the
Italian musical term forte (always pronounced / f r- [[t]]

/), meaning “loud.”

courage. 

  Mental  strength  that  allows  one  to  face  danger,  pain,  or  hardship  with

• He's just too nice, and we worry that he won't have the fortitude to deal with the monsters in that
office. 

How  many  people  know  that  the  famous  marble  lions  that  guard  the  steps  of  the  New  York  Public
Library in Manhattan are named Patience and Fortitude? In Latin, the quality of fortitudo combines
physical  strength,  vigor,  courage,  and  boldness,  but  the  English  fortitude  usually  means  simply
firmness and steadiness of will, or “backbone.” The philosopher Plato long ago listed four essential
human virtues—prudence (i.e., good judgment), justice (i.e., ability to be fair in balancing between
one's  own  interests  and  others'),  temperance  (i.e.,  moderation  or  restraint),  and  fortitude,  and  in
Christian tradition these became known as the four “cardinal virtues.”
