- GNI/GNO comes from a Greek and Latin verb meaning “to know,” and can be found at the root of
know itself. Among other words built from this root, you may recognize (“know again”) some and be
ignorant of (“not know”) others. But only an ignoramus would know absolutely none of them.

- [[cognitive]] 
  (1)  Having  to  do  with  the  process  of  knowing,  including  awareness,
judgment,  and  understanding.  (2)  Based  on  factual  knowledge  that  has  been  or  can  be  gained  by
experience. 

•  A  child  isn't  a  computer;  a  third-grader's  cognitive  abilities  are  highly  dependent  on  his  or  her
upbringing and happiness. 

Cognitive  skills  and  knowledge  involve  the  ability  to  acquire  factual  information,  often  the  kind  of
knowledge that can easily be tested. So cognition should be distinguished from social, emotional, and
creative development and ability. Cognitive science is a growing field of study that deals with human
perception, thinking, and learning.

- [[agnostic]] 
cannot be known. 

 A person who believes that whether God exists is not known and probably

• Both of them were always agnostics, but after they had children they started attending church again. 

The words agnostic and agnosticism were coined around 1870 by the great English biologist T. H.
Huxley, who had just spent a decade defending the works of Charles Darwin against the attacks of the
church. Scientists often put a high value on evidence when arguing about religion, and many agnostic
thinkers believe that human minds simply aren't equipped to grasp the nature of God. But agnostics
differ from atheists, who actually claim that no God exists and may even think they can prove it. You
may have seen the similar word gnostic, the name for followers of certain religious sects from around
the  time  of  Christ  that  sought  spiritual  knowledge  and  rejected  the  material  world.  An  increasing
interest in gnosticism  today  can  be  seen  in  the  popular  novels  of  Philip  Pullman,  Dan  Brown,  and
Neil Gaiman.

- [[incognito]] 

 In disguise, or with one's identity concealed. 

• Years after her reign as a top Hollywood star, she was discovered working incognito as a bartender
in Manhattan while living in cheap hotels. 

In a famous myth, Zeus and Hermes visit a village incognito to test the villagers. The seemingly poor
travelers  are  turned  away  from  every  household  except  that  of  Baucis  and  Philemon.  This  elderly
couple, though very poor themselves, provide the disguised gods with a feast. When the gods finally
reveal themselves, they reward the couple generously for their hospitality, but destroy the rest of the
village.

- [[prognosis]] 
forecast or prophecy. 

  (1)  The  chance  of  recovery  from  a  given  disease  or  condition.  (2)  A

• The prognosis for a patient with chicken pox is usually excellent; the prognosis for someone with
liver cancer is terrible. 

With its prefix pro-, meaning “before,” prognosis means basically “knowledge beforehand” of how a
situation is likely to turn out. Prognosis was originally a strictly medical term, but it soon broadened
to  include  predictions  made  by  experts  of  all  kinds.  Thus,  for  example,  economists  are  constantly
offering prognoses (notice the irregular plural form) about where the economy is going, and climate
scientists regularly prognosticate about how quickly the earth's atmosphere is warming.
