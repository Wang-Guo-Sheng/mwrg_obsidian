- CIS comes from the Latin verb meaning “to cut, cut down, or slay.” An incisor is one of the big front
biting  teeth;  beavers  and  woodchucks  have  especially  large  ones.  A  decision  “cuts  off”  previous
discussion and uncertainty.

- [[concise]] 

 Brief and condensed, especially in expression or statement. 

•  Professor  Childs's  exam  asked  for  a  concise,  one-page  summary  of  the  causes  of  the  American
Revolution. 

Many students think that adding unnecessary sentences with long words will make their writing more
impressive. But in fact almost every reader values concision, since concise writing is usually easier
to read, better thought out, and better organized—that is, simply better writing. Words such as short
don't  have  the  full  meaning  of  concise,  which  usually  means  not  just  “brief”  but  “packed  with
information.”

- [[excise]] 

 To cut out, especially surgically. 

•  The  ancient  Minoans  from  the  island  of  Crete  apparently  excised  the  hearts  of  their  human
sacrifices. 

Excise takes part of its meaning from the prefix ex-, “out.” A writer may excise long passages of a
novel to reduce it to a reasonable length, or a film director may excise a scene that might give offense.
A surgeon may excise a large cancerous tumor, or make a tiny excision to examine an organ's tissue.
Excise is also a noun, meaning a tax paid on something manufactured and sold in the U.S. Much of
what consumers pay for tobacco or alcohol products go to cover the excise taxes that the state and
federal government charge the manufacturers. But it's only accidental that this noun is spelled like the
verb, since it comes from a completely different source.

- [[incisive]] 

 Impressively direct and decisive. 

• A few incisive questions were all that was needed to expose the weakness in the prosecutor's case. 

From its roots, incise  means  basically  “to  cut  into.”  So  just  as  a  doctor  uses  a  scalpel  to  make  an
incision in the skin, an incisive remark cuts into the matter at hand. A good analyst makes incisive
comments  about  a  news  story,  cutting  through  the  unimportant  details,  and  a  good  critic  incisively
identifies a book's strengths and weaknesses.

- [[precision]] 

 Exactness and accuracy. 

• By junior year she was speaking with greater precision, searching for exact words in place of the
crude, awkward language of her friends. 

Many of us often use precision and accuracy as synonyms, but not scientists and engineers. For them,
accuracy  describes  a  particular  measurement—that  is,  how  close  it  is  to  the  truth.  But  precision
describes  a  measurement  system—that  is,  how  good  it  is  at  giving  the  same  result  every  time  it
measures  the  same  thing.  This  may  be  why  even  nonscientists  now  often  speak  of  “precision
instruments” for measuring, “precision landings” made by airplanes, “precision drilling” for natural
gas, and so on.

apiary 

 A place where bees are kept for their honey. 

• Apple orchards are excellent sites for apiaries, since the bees keep the apple trees productive by
pollinating them. 

Beekeeping, or apiculture, is the care of honeybees that ensures that they produce more honey than
they  can  use.  An  apiary  usually  consists  of  many  separate  beehives.  The  social  life  of  a  hive  is
strange and marvelous. The queen bee, who will become the mother of an entire colony, is actually
created by being fed “royal jelly” while she is still only a larva. The tens of thousands of worker bees
are  underdeveloped  females;  only  a  handful  of  the  bees  are  male,  and  they  do  no  work  at  all.  The
workers defend the hive by kamikaze means, stinging any intruder and dying as they do so. There's
more drama in a quiet-looking apiary than the casual observer might notice.

- [[caper]] 

 (1) A playful leap. (2) A prank or mischievous adventure. 

• For their caper in the girls' bathroom, all three seniors were suspended for a week. 

Caper  in  Latin  means  “a  male  goat.”  Anyone  who  has  watched  a  young  goat  frolic  in  a  field  or
clamber onto the roof of a car knows the kind of crazy fun the English word caper —which is also a
verb—is referring to. A capriole is a backward kick done in midair by a trained horse. Capricorn,
meaning “horned goat,” is a constellation and one of the signs of the zodiac. And a capricious act is
one that's done with as little thought as a frisky goat might give it.

- [[equestrian]] 

 Of or relating to horseback riding. 

•  The  circus's  equestrian  acts,  in  which  bareback  riders  performed  daring  acrobatic  feats  atop
prancing horses, were her favorites. 

Equestrian comes from equus, Latin for “horse.” Old statues of military heroes, like the famous one
of  General  Sherman  on  New  York's  Fifth  Avenue,  are  frequently  equestrian.  In  these  sculptures  the
man  always  sits  nobly  upright  on  a  horse,  but  the  horse's  stance  varies;  depending  on  whether  the
rider was killed in battle or survived, was victorious or defeated, the horse traditionally stands with
four, three, or two hooves on the ground. Equestrian statues have been popular through the centuries,
because until the 20th century almost every officer in Europe and America was trained in equestrian
skills and combat.

- [[lupine]] 

 Like a wolf; wolfish. 

• Doctors reported that the boy showed lupine behavior such as snarling and biting, and walked with
his knees bent in a kind of crouch. 

Lupine  comes  from  lupus,  Latin  for  “wolf,”  and  its  related  adjective  lupinus,  “wolfish.”  Lupine
groups  have  a  highly  organized  social  structure,  with  leaders  and  followers  clearly  distinguished;
dogs, since they're descended from wolves, often show these lupine patterns when living in groups.
Stories  of  children  raised  by  wolves  (the  most  famous  being  Romulus,  the  legendary  founder  of
Rome)  have  generally  been  hard  to  prove,  partly  because  “wild”  children  lack  human  language
abilities and can't describe their experiences. Lupine is also a noun, the name of a well-known garden
flower, which was once thought to drain, or “wolf,” the soil of its nutrients.

- [[ovine]] 

 Of, relating to, or resembling sheep. 

•  In  her  veterinary  practice  she  specialized  in  ovine  medicine,  but  often  treated  cows  and  pigs  as
well. 

Sheep belong to the same family of mammals as goats, antelope, bison, buffalo, and cows. The genus
Ovis includes at least five species, including the domestic sheep. Some 12,000 years ago, in the area
now known as Iraq, sheep became one of the first animals to be domesticated; only the dog is known
to have been tamed earlier. At first, they were valued for their milk, skin, and meat (mutton and lamb);
not  until  about  1500  B.C.  did  the  weaving  of  wool  begin.  Today  a  billion  sheep  are  being  farmed
worldwide. The term ovine (which is a noun as well as an adjective) is mostly used in scientific and
medical  writing—which  means  you  could  impress  your  friends  by  dropping  it  into  a  casual
conversation.

- [[ornithologist]] 

 A person who studies birds. 

•  John  James  Audubon,  the  great  painter  of  the  birds  of  early  America,  was  also  a  writing
ornithologist of great importance. 

The  Greek  root  ornith-  means  “bird,”  so  ornithology  is  the  study  of  birds.  Amateur  ornithology,
usually called birding or birdwatching, is an extraordinarily popular pastime in America, where over
40  million  people  pursue  it.  Roger  Tory  Peterson's  many  field  guides  have  long  been  some  of  the
amateur  ornithologist's  most  useful  tools.  Amateurs  often  make  essential  contributions  to  serious
ornithology, as in the annual Christmas Bird Count, when tens of thousands of birders fan out across
North and South America to produce a kind of census of all the species in the New World.

- [[serpentine]] 

 Like a snake or serpent in shape or movement; winding. 

• The Great Wall of China, the greatest construction of all time, wends its serpentine way for some
4,000 miles across the Chinese landscape. 

A snake moves by curving and winding along the ground. Roads through the Pyrenees, the mountains
that separate Spain from France, tend to be serpentine, curving back and forth on themselves up and
down  the  steep  slopes.  Serpentine  has  other  meanings  as  well.  As  a  noun,  it's  the  name  for  a  soft
green mineral, and also for the party streamers you might throw at midnight on New Year's Eve. The
serpentine belt under the hood in your car is the long, looping belt that most of the car's accessories
—the AC, the power steering, the alternator, and so on—depend on to get their power.

- [[simian]] 

 Having to do with monkeys or apes; monkeylike. 

• Every afternoon the pale youth could be found watching the simian antics in the Monkey House with
strange intensity. 

The Latin word for “ape” is simia, which itself comes from simus, “snub-nosed.” Simian is usually a
scientific word; thus, for instance, biologists study simian viruses in the search for cures to AIDS and
other diseases. But simian can be used by the rest of us to describe human behavior. Human babies
often cling to their mothers in a simian way, and kids playing on a jungle gym may look like simians.
But if you notice that a friend has a simian style of walking or eating bananas, it might be best not to
tell him.
