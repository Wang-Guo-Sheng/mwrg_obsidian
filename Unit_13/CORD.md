CORD,  from  the  Latin  word  for  “heart,”  turns  up  in  several  common  English  words.  So  does  its
Greek relative card-, which is familiar to us in words such as cardiac, “relating to the heart.”

- [[accord]] 

 (1) To grant. (2) To be in harmony; agree. 

• What she told police under questioning didn't accord with the accounts of the other witnesses. 

A new federal law may accord with—or be in accordance with—the guidelines that a company has
already established. The rowdy behavior of the hero Beowulf accords with Norse ideals of the early
Middle Ages; but such behavior wouldn't have been in accordance with the ideals of a later young
lord  from  the  same  general  region,  Shakespeare's  Prince  Hamlet.  Accord  is  also  a  noun,  meaning
“agreement.”  Thus,  we  often  hear  of  two  countries  signing  a  peace  accord;  and  we  also  frequently
hear of two things or people being “in accord with” each other.

- [[concord]] 

 (1) A state of agreement: harmony. (2) A formal agreement. 

• In 1801 Napoleon signed a concord with the pope reestablishing the Catholic Church in France. 

The  roots  of  concord  suggest  the  meaning  “hearts  together.”  At  the  very  outset  of  the  American
Revolution,  the  town  of  Concord,  Massachusetts,  was  the  site  of  a  famous  battle—obviously  not
exactly in keeping with its name. It shares that name with the capital of New Hampshire and a few
other towns and cities, and Concordia, the original Latin word for “concord,” is the name of several
Lutheran  universities.  Today  concord  is  a  rather  formal  term,  probably  most  often  used  to  mean  a
specific agreement; thus, two countries may sign a concord on matters that have led to trouble in the
past.

- [[cordial]] 

 Warm, friendly, gracious. 

•  After  the  meeting,  the  president  extended  a  cordial  invitation  to  everyone  for  coffee  at  her  own
house. 

Anything  that  is  cordial  comes  from  the  heart.  Cordial  greetings  to  friends  on  the  street,  or  cordial
relations between two countries, are warm without being passionate. Cordial is also a noun, which
originally meant any stimulating medicine or drink that was thought to be good for the heart. Today a
cordial is a liqueur, a sweetened alcoholic drink with interesting flavoring. Cordials such as crème
de menthe, Drambuie, or Benedictine are alcoholic enough to warm the spirits and the heart.

- [[discordant]] 

 Being at odds, conflicting, not in harmony. 

• The first discordant note at dinner was struck by my cousin, when he claimed the president was only
interested in taking away our guns. 

Discord,  a  word  more  common  in  earlier  centuries  than  today,  means  basically  “conflict,”  so
discordant  often  means  “conflicting.”  The  opinions  of  Supreme  Court  justices  are  frequently
discordant;  justices  who  disagree  with  the  Court's  decision  usually  write  a  dissenting  opinion.
Discordant is often used with a somewhat musical meaning, suggesting that a single wrong note or
harmony has been heard in the middle of a performance—even though musical words such as chord
actually come from a different Latin word, meaning “cord” or “string” (a reference to the strings of
ancient instruments such as the lyre).

- CULP comes from the Latin word for “guilt.” Its best-known appearance in English is probably in
