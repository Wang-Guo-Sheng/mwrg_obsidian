- CULP comes from the Latin word for “guilt.” Its best-known appearance in English is probably in
culprit, meaning someone who is guilty of a crime.

- [[culpable]] 

 Deserving to be condemned or blamed. 

• The company was found guilty of culpable negligence in allowing the chemical waste to leak into
the groundwater. 

Culpable  normally  means  simply  “guilty.”  To  a  lawyer,  “culpable  negligence”  is  carelessness  so
serious that it becomes a crime—for instance, building a swimming pool in your suburban yard with
no fence around it, so that a neighbor's child could fall in and drown. But degrees of culpability are
important  in  the  law;  someone  who  intended  to  do  harm  always  faces  a  more  serious  challenge  in
court than someone who was merely careless.

- [[exculpate]] 

 To clear from accusations of fault or guilt. 

• The girls aren't proud of what they did that night, but they've been exculpated by witnesses and won't
be facing criminal charges. 

Exculpate  gets  its  meaning  from  the  prefix  ex-,  which  here  means  “out  of”  or  “away  from.”  A
suspected  murderer  may  be  exculpated  by  the  confession  of  another  person.  And  exculpatory
evidence is the kind that defense lawyers are always looking for.

- [[inculpate]] 
fault or crime. 

 To accuse or incriminate; to show evidence of someone's involvement in a

• It was his own father who finally inculpated him, though without intending to. 

Inculpate is the opposite of exculpate, just as inculpatory evidence is the opposite of exculpatory
evidence. By inculpating someone else, an accused person may manage to exculpate himself. Through
plea bargaining, the prosecution can often encourage a defendant to inculpate his friends in return for
a lighter sentence.

- [[mea]] culpa 

 An admission of personal fault or error. 

• The principal said his mea culpa at the school board meeting, but not all the parents were satisfied. 

Mea culpa, Latin for “through my fault,” comes from the prayer in the Catholic mass in which, back
when Latin was still the language of the mass, one would confess to having sinned “mea culpa, mea
culpa,  mea  maxima  culpa”  (“through  my  fault,  through  my  fault,  through  my  most  grievous  fault”).
When we say “Mea culpa” today, it means “I apologize” or “It was my fault.” But mea culpa is also
common as a noun. So, for instance, a book may be a long mea culpa for the author's past treatment of
women, or an oil company may issue a mea culpa after a tanker runs aground.
