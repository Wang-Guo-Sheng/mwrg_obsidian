- ART comes from the Latin word for “skill.” This reminds us that, until a few centuries ago, almost no
one made a strong distinction between skilled craftsmanship and what we would now call “art.” And
the word art itself could also mean simply “cleverness.” The result is that this root appears in some
words where we might not expect it.

- [[artful]] 

 (1) Skillful. (2) Wily, crafty, sly. 

• It was an artful solution: each side was pleased with the agreement, but it was the lawyer himself
who stood to make the most money off of it. 

A  writer  may  produce  an  artful  piece  of  prose,  one  that's  clearly  and  elegantly  written.  The  same
writer might also make an artful argument, one that cleverly leaves out certain details and plays up
others so as to make a stronger case. In the first instance, the prose is well crafted; in the second, the
argument  might  instead  be  called  crafty.  But  even  though  both  uses  are  correct,  most  of  us  still  use
artful somewhat differently from artistic.

- [[artifact]] 
ornament, that represents a culture or a stage in a culture's development. 

  A  usually  simple  object  made  by  human  workmanship,  such  as  a  tool  or

• Through the artifacts found by archaeologists, we now know a considerable amount about how the
early Anasazi people of the Southwest lived. 

One of the things that make humans unique is their ability to make and use tools, and ever since the
first  rough  stone  axes  began  to  appear  about  700,000  years  ago,  human  cultures  have  left  behind
artifacts from which we've tried to draw a picture of their everyday life. The roots of artifact mean
basically “something made with skill”; thus, a mere stone that was used for pounding isn't an artifact,
since it wasn't shaped by humans for its purpose—unlike a ram's horn that was polished and given a
brass mouthpiece and was blown as part of a religious ritual.

- [[artifice]] 

 (1) Clever skill. (2) A clever trick. 

• By his cunning and artifice, Iago convinces Othello that Desdemona has been unfaithful. 

Artifice can be a tricky word to use. It combines the same roots as artifact, so it's sometimes seen in
descriptions  of  craftsmanship  (“The  artifice  that  went  into  this  jewelry  can  still  astound  us,”  “The
chef had used all his artifice to disguise the nature of the meat”). But it can also be used for many
situations  that  don't  involve  physical  materials  (“They  had  gotten  around  the  rules  by  a  clever
artifice,”  “The  artifice  of  the  plot  is  ingenious”).  Like  its  adjective,  artificial,  artifice  isn't
necessarily either positive nor negative. But both words can make us slightly uncomfortable if we like
to think of simplicity and naturalness as important values.

- [[artisan]] 

 A skilled worker or craftsperson. 

• At the fair, they saw examples of the best carving, pottery, and jewelry by local artisans. 

Artisans aren't the same as artists, but it can sometimes be hard to tell the difference. In the Middle
Ages,  artisans  organized  themselves  into  guilds.  In  every  city  each  group  of  artisans—weavers,
carpenters, shoemakers, and so on—had its own guild, which set wages and prices, kept standards
high, and protected its members from outside competitors. In America, however, most artisans have
always  been  fiercely  independent.  Today,  when  factories  produce  almost  all  of  our  goods,  artisans
usually make only fine objects for those who can afford them. And we now even include food among
the  artisan's  crafts,  so  you  can  buy  artisanal  cheeses,  breads,  and  chocolates—but  probably  not  if
you're watching your budget.
