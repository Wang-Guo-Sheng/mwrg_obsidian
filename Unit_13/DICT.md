- DICT comes from dicere, the Latin word meaning “to speak.” So a dictionary is a treasury of words
for  speaking.  And  a  contradiction  (with  its  prefix  contra-,  “against”)  speaks  against  or  denies
something.

- [[diction]] 
effectiveness. (2) Clarity of speech. 

  (1)  Choice  of  words,  especially  with  regard  to  correctness,  clearness,  or

• Our CEO is determined to appear in some TV ads, but he first needs to work on his diction with a
vocal coach. 

When  your  English  teacher  complains  about  some  of  the  words  you  chose  to  use  in  an  essay,  she's
talking about your diction. She may also use the term when commenting on the word choices made by
a poet, and why a particular word was the best one possible in a particular line. (Compare syntax.)
But the second meaning of diction is just as common, and your English teacher might use that one on
you  as  well,  especially  when  she's  asked  you  to  read  something  aloud  and  you  mumble  your  way
through it.

- [[edict]] 

 (1) An official announcement that has the force of a law. (2) An order or command. 

• In 1989 an edict by the leader of Iran pronouncing a death sentence on a British novelist stunned the
world. 

Edicts  are  few  and  far  between  in  a  democracy,  since  very  few  important  laws  can  be  made  by  a
president or prime minister acting alone. But when a crisis arose in the Roman Republic, the senate
would appoint a dictator, who would have the power to rule by edict. The idea was that the dictator
could make decisions quickly, issuing his edicts faster than the senate could act. When the crisis was
over, the edicts were canceled and the dictator usually retired from public life. Things are different
today: dictators almost always install themselves in power, and they never give it up.

- [[jurisdiction]] 
territory where power may be exercised. 

  (1)  The  power  or  right  to  control  or  exercise  authority.  (2)  The

• Unluckily for the defendants, the case fell within the jurisdiction of the federal court rather than the
more tolerant state court. 

Questions  of  jurisdiction  are  generally  technical  legal  matters.  The  most  important  ones  include
which court will hear a given case and which law-enforcement agency can get involved. But although
they may seem like mere technicalities, jurisdictional matters sometimes turn out to be all-important
in the final outcome. Jurisdiction may depend on where you are (for example, in which state), on who
you are (if you're a juvenile, for example, you may only be tried in juvenile court), and on what the
subject  is  (for  example,  cases  involving  the  estate  left  by  someone  who  has  died  are  dealt  with  in
probate court).

- [[dictum]] 

 A formal and authoritative statement. 

•  It  has  long  been  a  dictum  of  American  foreign  policy  that  the  government  doesn't  negotiate  with
kidnappers and terrorists. 

The word dictum is frequently used in philosophy, but also in economics, political science, and other
fields. Almost any condensed piece of wisdom—”The perfect is the enemy of the good,” “Buy low,
sell high,” “All politics is local,” etc.—can be called a dictum. In the law, judges may often add to a
written  opinion  an  obiter  dictum,  or  “statement  made  in  passing”—a  strong  statement  that  isn't
directly  relevant  to  the  case  being  decided.  If  they're  well  thought  out  and  eloquent,  obiter  dicta
(notice the plural form) may be referred to by later judges and lawyers for years afterward.

- GNI/GNO comes from a Greek and Latin verb meaning “to know,” and can be found at the root of
