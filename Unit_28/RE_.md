- RE_, in its other main sense, means “back” or backward.” Since doing something again means going
back to it, the two senses are actually related; still, the meaning of re- [[in]] most words is pretty clearly
one or the other. So a rebound comes back at you; to recall means to “call back” a memory; and to
react is to “act back” at someone else's action.

- [[reciprocal]] 
such a way that one completes the other or is the equal of the other. 

 (1) Done, given, or felt equally by both sides. (2) Related to each other in

• They had done us a great favor, so as a reciprocal gesture we invited them for a weekend on the
island. 

In Latin, reciprocus means “returning the same way” or “alternating.” So in a reciprocating engine,
like the one in your car, the pistons move back and forth, and that motion is transformed into the rotary
motion  of  the  crankshaft.  A  reciprocal  is  a  pair  of  numbers  (such  as  5/6  and  6/5)  that  can  be
multiplied  to  produce  1.  Reciprocity  (with  the  accent  on  the  third  syllable)  between  two  nations
means they agree to recognize certain things granted in one country as being valid in the other—for
example, your driver's license.

- [[rebut]] 

 (1) To oppose by argument. (2) To prove to be wrong. 

• The claims about receiving payoffs from builders were eventually rebutted by the mayor's office,
but the damage had been done. 

The -but in rebut once meant basically “butt,” so rebut's  original  meanings  were  “to  drive  or  beat
back” and “to attack with violent language.” Rebuttals can still be rather violent, as anyone who has
watched  some  heated  moments  in  a  presidential  debate  can  testify.  The  word  is  often  used  by
lawyers, since the lawyer for the accused or for the party being sued almost always tries to rebut the
charges against his or her client; but it's also used in plenty of contexts outside the courtroom.

- [[revoke]] 
privilege). 

  To  officially  cancel  the  power  or  effect  of  something  (such  as  a  law,  order,  or

• His real-estate license had been revoked after his conviction for fraud three years earlier. 

Since vocare means “to call” in Latin (see VOC), to revoke is to “call back.” Your driver's license
could  be  revoked  after  about  three  convictions  for  driving  under  the  influence  of  alcohol;  some
people's licenses are even revoked for life. You could get your passport revoked if a judge thought
you had violated the terms of your bail and suspected you might skip the country. And if you're out of
prison on probation and violate the terms of probation, it will probably be revoked and you'll end up
back in the slammer.

- [[regress]] 

 To return to an earlier and usually worse or less developed condition or state. 

• In the years since she had left, the country seemed to have regressed badly, and its corruption and
dire poverty had gotten much harder to ignore. 

As you might guess, regress is the opposite of progress. So if a disease regresses, that's generally a
good  thing,  but  in  most  other  ways  we  prefer  not  to  regress.  If  someone's  mental  state  has  been
improving,  we  hope  he  or  she  won't  start  to  regress;  and  when  a  nation's  promising  educational
system  begins  to  regress,  that's  a  bad  sign  for  the  country's  future.  Economists  often  distinguish
between a progressive tax and a regressive tax; in a progressive tax, the percentage that goes to taxes
gets larger as the amount of money being taxed gets larger, while in a regressive tax the percentage
gets smaller. (Rich people prefer regressive taxes.)
