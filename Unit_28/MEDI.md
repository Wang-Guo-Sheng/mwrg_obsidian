MEDI comes from the Latin medius, meaning “middle.” Our word medium refers to something in a
middle  position.  The  medieval  period  of  European  history,  also  known  as  the  Middle  Ages,  is  the
period  between  Greek  and  Roman  antiquity  and  the  “modern  age.”  But  why  people  around  1620
began to use the term “Middle Ages,” because they regarded themselves as modern, is an interesting
question.

• The city's west side is well-off but its east side isn't, so the city's median house prices are typical
for the region. 

People  often  use  the  word  average  without  realizing  that  there  are  two  common  forms  of  average.
Suppose you want to find the average net worth of a group of people—that is, the average value of
everything they possess. To find one type of average, called the mean, you'd simply add up the total
value of money and property of everyone in the group and divide it by the number of people. To find
the other type, called the median, you'd identify the net worth of the person who is richer than half the
people and poorer than the other half. So if Warren Buffett drove through a tiny village in India, the
mean  net  worth  of  those  in  the  village  would  suddenly  rise  to  perhaps  a  billion  dollars,  but  their
median net worth would remain close to zero. Which figure would be more meaningful?

• He was the third person who had attempted to mediate the dispute between the firm and its striking
workers, the first two having given up in despair. 

Mediation is often used in disputes between companies and labor unions, and the government actually
provides  mediators  for  such  disagreements.  The  mediator  tries  to  bring  the  two  sides  to  an
agreement, but doesn't have the power to actually order such an agreement. Mediators also sometimes
have a role in international disputes; when two neighboring countries claim exclusive fishing rights in
the same ocean waters, for example, they may invite a trained mediator to help settle the argument.
Arbitration  is  similar  to  mediation,  but  in  arbitration  both  parties  in  a  dispute  agree  to  accept  the
arbitrator's decision.

• The divorce had been bitter, and the two now communicated only through an old friend who they
both trusted as an intermediary. 

Since inter- [[means]] “between, among” (see INTER), an intermediary is someone who moves back and
forth  in  the  middle  area  between  two  sides—a  “go-between.”  Mediator  (which  shares  the  medi-
root) is often a synonym, and so is facilitator; broker and agent are often others. Thus, a real-estate
broker  or  agent  shuttles  between  a  house's  buyer  and  seller,  who  may  never  even  meet  each  other.
Financial intermediation is what happens when you put money in a bank or investment firm, which
then invests it in various companies; if you want, you can instead cut out the intermediary and invest
the money directly in companies of your own choosing.

- [[mediocrity]] 

 The quality of being not very good. 

• He's the kind of person who can get depressed by the mediocrity of a dinner, or even a wine. 

People  interested  in  words  always  point  out  that  mediocrity  doesn't  mean  quite  what  its  main  root
would indicate: Why doesn't it describe something that's right in the middle of the pack, exactly what
you  would  expect?  Instead  the  words  mediocrity  and  mediocre  always  suggest  disappointment.  A
mediocre play is one you wish you hadn't wasted an evening on, and the mediocre actor in it should
probably find another profession. A person can even be called a mediocrity, though it isn't very nice
and you'd never do it to his face.
