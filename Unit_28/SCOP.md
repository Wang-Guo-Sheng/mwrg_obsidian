- SCOP,  which  usually  appears  in  a  suffix,  comes  from  the  Greek  skopein,  meaning  “to  look  at.”  In
English  we  have  the  simple  noun  scope,  along  with  some  other  words  it  sometimes  stands  for:
telescope, microscope, periscope, and so on. And have you ever used a stereoscope, a device your
great-grandparents probably enjoyed, which lets you look through a viewer at two slightly different
photographs of the same thing, one with each eye, to enjoy the illusion that you're seeing it in three
dimensions?

- [[endoscope]] 
 A lighted tubular medical instrument for viewing the interior or a hollow
organ or body part that typically has one or more channels to permit passage of surgical instruments. 

•  Possible  uses  of  the  endoscope  outside  of  medicine  soon  became  apparent,  and  soon  mechanics
were using specially designed endoscopes to view the insides of jet engines. 

The Greek prefix endo- [[means]] “within, inside,” so around 1860 an early crude instrument for looking
deep inside the body was named the endoscope. But modern endoscopy required the invention of the
electric  lightbulb  and  then  fiber-optic  cable,  so  the  first  modern  endoscopes  date  only  to  1967.  An
endoscope may be inserted through a natural passageway (for example, through the nose or down the
esophagus) or through a tiny cut in the skin. A tiny camera with a light at the end of the cable sends
back  images  onto  a  screen,  and  the  surgeon  uses  special  instruments  that  work  through  a  tube
alongside the cable. There are now specialized types of endoscopes for every part of the body, where
they can take tissue samples, cut out small growths, or remove foreign objects.

- [[arthroscopic]] 
incision near a joint to examine the joint's interior. 

  Relating  to  a  fiber-optic  instrument  that  is  inserted  through  an

• The day he scheduled the fourth arthroscopic operation on his knee was the day he decided to hang
up his football cleats. 

In  Greek,  arthron  means  “joint.”  Arthritis  is  a  condition  of  swollen  and  painful  joints,  and
arthropods  are  animals  (including  insects,  arachnids,  and  crustaceans)  that  have  a  segmented  body
and  jointed  limbs.  Arthroscopic  surgery,  or  arthroscopy,  has  revolutionized  the  treatment  of  joint
injuries.  It's  performed  with  an  arthroscope,  a  specialized  type  of  endoscope  (see  above).  A  tiny
camera and a light are inserted through a small cut in the skin, and through another cut nearby a tiny
surgical  instrument,  controlled  through  its  own  cable,  is  inserted.  The  surgeon  then  performs  the
operation,  guided  by  the  images  sent  back  via  the  fiber-optic  cable.  Most  patients  walk  out  of  the
hospital on crutches the same day, though full recovery may take a couple of months.

- [[laparoscopy]] 
instrument inserted through a cut in the abdomen's wall. 

  Examination  of  the  interior  of  the  abdomen  using  a  fiber-optic

• The initial laparoscopy involves inserting the cable through a tiny cut and inflating the internal area
with carbon dioxide so that a good-sized area will become visible. 

Since laparo- [[means]] “wall of the abdomen,” a laparoscope is an endoscope designed especially to
examine the abdomen. Common laparoscopic surgeries include removal of the gallbladder, appendix,
or  kidney,  and  removal  of  tumors  from  abdominal  organs.  Like  the  other  endoscopic  surgeries,
laparoscopy,  as  compared  to  traditional  surgery,  reduces  risk  of  bleeding,  pain  following  the
operation, patient recovery time, and length of hospital stays.

- [[oscilloscope]] 
on a screen. 

 An instrument that shows visual images of changing electrical current

•  An  oscilloscope  next  to  the  bed  was  monitoring  her  vital  signs,  but  otherwise  it  was  hard  for  a
visitor to be sure she was even alive. 

In  Latin  oscillare  means  “to  swing,”  and  our  word  oscillation  usually  means  “vibration”  or
“variation,” especially in a changing flow of electricity. The oscilloscope basically draws a graph of
an electrical signal. Since all kinds of physical phenomena can be converted into an electric voltage,
oscilloscopes can be used to measure such things as sound, light, and heat. So an oscilloscope can
analyze  how  one  clarinet's  sound  is  different  from  another's,  or  how  one  bulb's  light  differs  from
another's.  Auto  mechanics  use  oscilloscopes  to  measure  engine  vibrations;  doctors  use  them  to
measure brain waves. Audio technicians use oscilloscopes to diagnose problems in audio equipment;
TV and radio technicians use them to diagnose TV and radio problems. But oscilloscopes are most
essential today to high-tech electronics experimentation.

- TRANS comes from Latin to indicate movement “through, across, or beyond” something. Translation
