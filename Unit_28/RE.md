- RE is a prefix which, like pro- (see PRO), has more than one meaning. In this section, we'll focus on
the meaning “again.” We use re- [[words]] with this meaning every day—redo, reheat, recheck, reread,
resell, repaint,  etc.—and  we  feel  free  to  make  up  new  ones  as  needed.  But  in  plenty  of  other  re-
words, the meaning isn't so obvious.

- [[remorse]] 

 A deep regret arising from a sense of guilt for past wrongs. 

• Remorse for the accident that occurred that night seems to have altered the course of the senator's
life. 

In Latin, mordere means “to bite”; thus, remorse is something that “gnaws” at you over and over. In
criminal court, judges are always looking for signs that a convicted felon is suffering remorse for his
crime;  if  not,  the  judge  may  well  lengthen  his  sentence  or  deny  him  parole  after  serving  part  of  it.
Remorse is stronger than mere regret; real remorse is the kind of thing that may last a lifetime.

- [[reiterate]] 

 To state or do over again or repeatedly. 

• At the end of every class, Professor Lewis reiterates that we should get an early start on our term
papers. 

In Latin, iterum means “again,” so reiterate  has  the  basic  meaning  of  “repeat  over  and  over.”  Our
word iteration is used a lot by computer programmers today, often meaning a repeated response to
program instructions that gets something closer to its final form, but also often meaning a new version
of something, such as a program. But a reiteration is simply a repeat or several repeats.

- [[rejuvenate]] 

 To make young or youthful again; to give new vigor to. 

•  He  was  in  bad  shape  after  his  wife's  death,  but  everyone  says  he's  been  rejuvenated  by  his
remarriage. 

Juvenis, Latin for “young,” can be seen in a word such as juvenile. Rejuvenation is something that
can be carried out on a creaky old house, a clunker of a car, a sluggish career, a weak economy, or a
company that's lost its edge, but rejuvenate and rejuvenation are probably used most often for talking
about  our  physical  selves.  Ads  for  lotions  promise  skin  rejuvenation;  diet-book  covers  show
rejuvenated (or maybe just young) models bursting with health. We still seem to be searching for that
“Fuente de la Juventud” that Juan Ponce de León failed to discover five hundred years ago.

- [[reconcile]] 

 (1) To make agree. (2) To make friendly again. 

• Now she has to reconcile her liking for her brother-in-law with the news that he was picked up for
armed robbery last week. 

In  Latin,  conciliare  means  “to  calm,  soothe”;  thus,  reconcile  means  essentially  “to  calm  again.”
Warring friends can often be reconciled by a nice note or apology. When you're faced with two things
that don't square very well, you may have to reconcile them, the way a scientist might try to reconcile
the  differing  results  from  two  research  projects.  The  U.S.  House  and  Senate,  in  a  process  called
reconciliation,  try  to  produce  one  final  bill  from  two  different  versions  that  they've  passed
separately. To reconcile yourself to something means to get used to it; thus, you may need to reconcile
yourself to not getting to the beach next summer, or you may have reconciled yourself to the idea of
your daughter in the Peace Corps marrying a Mongolian goat herder.

- RE_, in its other main sense, means “back” or backward.” Since doing something again means going
