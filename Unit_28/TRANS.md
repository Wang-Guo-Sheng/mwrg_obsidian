- TRANS comes from Latin to indicate movement “through, across, or beyond” something. Translation
carries  a  writer's  meaning  from  one  language  to  another.  A  television  signal  is  sent  or  transmitted
through  the  air  (or  a  cable)  to  your  set.  When  making  your  way  through  a  city  on  public
transportation, you may have to transfer from one bus or subway to another.

- [[transient]] 
only briefly. 

 (1) Not lasting long; short-lived. (2) Passing through a place and staying

• It's a college town, so much of its population is transient. 

A transient mood is one that passes quickly. A brief stopover in a town on your way to somewhere
else is a transient visit. A summer job on a farm is transient work, lasting only as long as the growing
season.  You  may  occasionally  experience  a  transient  episode  of  dizziness  or  weakness,  which
vanishes without a trace. As a noun, transient means a person who passes through a place, staying
only  briefly.  The  hoboes  and  tramps  of  earlier  years  were  some  of  our  most  colorful  transients,
known for hopping freight trains, panhandling on the street, and stealing homemade pies cooling on
the windowsill.

- [[transfiguration]] 
change. 

  A  change  in  form  or  appearance;  a  glorifying  spiritual

• Being in love caused a complete transfiguration of her personality. 

The Gospels relate that one day Jesus took three disciples up a mountain, where they witnessed his
transfiguration  into  divine  form:  his  face  shone  like  the  sun,  his  garments  became  brilliantly  white,
and a voice from heaven proclaimed that this was the son of God. Transfiguration was first used in
English as the name of this biblical event, and the Feast of the Transfiguration remains the name of a
holy day. So the word has always kept a somewhat religious—and almost always positive—tone. A
face  may  be  transfigured  by  joy,  and  an  “ugly  duckling”  may  be  slowly  transfigured  into  a  radiant
beauty. And as Harry Potter fans know, transfiguration is a subject long taught at the Hogwarts School
by Minerva McGonagall.

- [[transponder]] 
signal. 

 A radio or radar set that emits a radio signal after receiving such a

• When a patient is admitted to an emergency room, an implanted transponder can relay important data
about his or her medical history. 

This word was coined during World War II by simply joining pieces of the words transmitter and
responder.  Transponders  are  basic  to  modern  aviation  and  communications  satellites,  and  they're
finding new uses in fields such as medicine as well. But they're now also part of everyday life. The
“E-ZPass”  that  lets  you  drive  right  through  turnpike  tollbooths  is  a  transponder,  and  the  car  you're
driving may not even start unless it recognizes the signal from your personal key's transponder. In a
big crowded foot race, you may carry a tiny transponder on your shoe that records when you cross
both the starting line and the finish line.

- [[transcendent]] 
comprehension; beyond ordinary experience or material existence. 

  (1)  Exceeding  or  rising  above  usual  limits;  supreme.  (2)  Beyond

• Despite the chaos around her she remained calm, with a transcendent smile on her face. 

The Latin verb scandere means “to climb,” so transcend has the basic meaning of climbing so high
that  you  cross  some  boundary.  A  transcendent  experience  is  one  that  takes  you  out  of  yourself  and
convinces you of a larger life or existence; in this sense, it means something close to “spiritual.” The
American writers and thinkers known as the Transcendentalists, including Ralph Waldo Emerson and
Henry David Thoreau, believed in the unity of all creation, the basic goodness of humankind, and the
superiority of spiritual vision over mere logic. When we speak of the transcendent importance of an
issue such as climate change, we may mean that everything else on earth actually depends on it.
