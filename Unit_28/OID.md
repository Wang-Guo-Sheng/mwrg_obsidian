- OID  comes  from  the  Greek  word  for  “appearance”  or  “form.”  Since  aster  in  ancient  Greek  meant
“star,”  the  small  bodies  orbiting  between  Mars  and  Jupiter  that  looked  like  stars  through  primitive
telescopes were called asteroids. A factoid is a little bit of information that looks like a fact, whether
it  is  or  not.  And  some  people  these  days  will  attach  -oid  to  just  about  anything;  you  can  probably
figure out the meaning of nutsoid, nerdoid, and freakazoid without much help.

- [[rhomboid]] 
angles are equal. 

  In  geometry,  a  shape  with  four  sides  where  only  the  opposite  sides  and

•  The  flimsy  picture  frame  had  been  damaged  en  route,  and  its  rectangular  shape  was  now  a
rhomboid. 

Rhomboids,  like  triangles,  may  take  various  different  shapes,  but  they  always  look  like  a  lopsided
diamond  or  rectangle.  As  both  a  noun  and  an  adjective,  rhomboid  can  be  applied  to  anything  with
those  shapes,  such  as  certain  muscles  of  the  upper  back  when  viewed  from  behind.  Whenever  you
hear about rhomboid exercises, rhomboid strain, or rhomboid pain, it involves those muscles, which
attach your shoulder blades to your spine and can be strained by carrying a heavy backpack, serving a
tennis ball, or just slumping in your chair in front of a computer all day.

- [[deltoid]] 

 A large muscle of the shoulder. 

• In Anatomy class she had learned about the deltoids, which her trainer at the gym just called “delts.”

The  fourth  letter  of  the  Greek  alphabet  is  delta,  and  a  capital  delta  is  triangle-shaped.  In  English,
delta commonly means the sand deposits that form a huge triangle at the mouth of certain large rivers.
Deltoid  as  an  adjective  means  “having  a  triangular  shape,”  and  botanists  often  use  the  word  to
describe the shape of certain leaves. The triangular, swept-back wings seen on jet fighter aircraft are
called  delta  wings.  Your  deltoid  muscles—not  far  from  your  rhomboids—form  a  cap  on  your
shoulders,  and  some  gym  trainers  even  treat  shoulder and deltoid  as  synonyms.  Can  you  guess  the
general shape of deltoids when seen from the side?

- [[dendroid]] 

 Resembling a tree in form. 

•  The  reef  was  a  fantastic  jungle,  its  dendroid  corals  resembling  luminous,  poisonous  trees  in  a
landscape of bizarre beauty. 

Dendrology  is  the  study  of  trees,  and  those  who  do  the  studying  are  called  dendrologists.  So
dendroid describes something that “branches” in all directions from a central “trunk” in an irregular
way. The word is almost always used by biologists, who often speak of dendroid seaweeds, dendroid
moss, and dendroid algae.

- [[humanoid]] 

 Looking or acting like a human. 

• We slowly learn that most of Dr. Bennell's friends have been replaced by humanoid substitutes that
have emerged from pods. 

A humanoid robot, sometimes called an android, is a robot that resembles a human. Accounts of the
yeti, Sasquatch, and Bigfoot continue to fascinate us mainly because of their humanoid characteristics.
The  idea  of  creating  a  monstrous  humanoid,  such  as  the  Jewish  golem  or  Victor  Frankenstein's
creation, has intrigued us for centuries. “Humanoid Animation” is a standard for creating humanlike
figures for video that lets the same figure be used in a variety of 3-D games—some of which have
nothing but humanoids for characters.
