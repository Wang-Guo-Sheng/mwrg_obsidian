- ENDO  comes  from  the  Greek  endon,  meaning  “within.”  In  English  it  appears  almost  always  in
scientific terms, especially in biology. A nonscientific endo- [[word]] is endogamy, meaning marriage
within  a  specific  group  as  required  by  custom  or  law—one  of  the  many  customs  that  can  be  seen
everywhere from the most remote tribes to the highest society in wealthy countries.

- [[endocrine]] 
their secretions directly into the blood or lymph. 

 (1) A hormone. (2) Any of several glands (such as the thyroid) that pour

• Since the endocrines are so vital to human life, affecting such things as cell growth and blood sugar,
the chemicals known as endocrine disrupters can be destructive and even deadly. 

The  body's  glands  remove  specific  substances  from  the  blood  and  alter  them  for  rerelease  into  the
blood or removal. Glands such as those that produce saliva and sweat secrete their products through
tiny  ducts  or  tubes  on  or  near  the  body's  surface.  The  glands  without  ducts,  called  the  endocrine
glands, instead secrete their products into the bloodstream; the endo- [[root]] indicates that the secretions
are  internal  rather  than  on  the  surface.  The  endocrine  system  includes  such  glands  as  the  pituitary
(which controls growth, regulates the other endocrines, and performs many other tasks), the thyroid
(another growth gland that also influences metabolism), the adrenals (which secrete adrenaline and
steroids), the hypothalamus (which influences sleep and weight regulation), and the ovaries (which
produce eggs). Endocrine problems are treated by endocrinologists.

- [[endodontic]] 

 Relating to a branch of dentistry that deals with the pulp of the teeth. 

• Her dentist told her the problem was endodontic and that she should see a specialist soon to prevent
loss of the tooth. 

Endodontists, as you might expect from the endo- [[root]], deal with the interior of the tooth. The tooth's
enamel,  on  the  outside,  covers  a  thick  layer  called  the  dentin;  this  in  turn  surrounds  the  innermost
part, called the pulp, a mass of soft tissue through which nerves and blood vessels run. When a tooth
has been badly damaged by decay or cracking, producing a risk of dangerous infection of the pulp, a
“root  canal”  procedure  is  performed  by  an  endodontist.  Try  to  avoid  ever  getting  to  know  an
endodontist; brush your teeth twice daily, floss before bedtime, and never let a cavity go unfilled for
long.

- [[endogenous]] 

 Developing or originating within a cell, organ, body, or system. 

•  Vitamin  D  can  be  obtained  from  food  and  supplements,  but  it's  also  an  endogenous  vitamin,
produced by the body when the skin is exposed to sunlight. 

When biologists need to make a distinction between things that are produced within a cell or organ
and things that affect it from the outside, they use the terms endogenous and exogenous. It used to be
thought,  for  instance,  that  mutations  in  cells  always  resulted  from  exogenous  causes,  until  it  was
discovered  that  substances  in  the  body,  including  those  called  oxidants,  could  cause  them
endogenously  as  well.  “Circadian  rhythms”—the  regular  cycles,  roughly  24  hours  in  length,  that
plants,  animals,  and  humans  rely  on  to  regulate  their  days—are  endogenously  generated  and  don't
actually depend on the sun for their timing.

- [[endorphin]] 

 Any of a group of proteins in the brain that are able to relieve pain. 

• On the final stretch of her daily five-mile run, she could usually count on the endorphins kicking in,
giving her that beautiful “runner's high.” 

The word endorphin was coined, back when the substances were discovered in the 1970s, by joining
pieces of endogenous and morphine, morphine being a narcotic that closely resembles the endorphins
and relieves pain in a similar way. Studies suggest that the pain-relieving practice called acupuncture
(see acupuncture) works by releasing endorphins. Endorphins also seem to play an important role in
pregnancy. Though much remains to be learned about the endorphins, the general public seems ready
to give them credit for any all-natural high.
