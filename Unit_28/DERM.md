- DERM comes from the Greek derma, meaning “skin.” For medical advice on a skin problem such as
acne,  we  may  go  to  a  dermatologist,  or  skin  specialist.  When  we  get  a  shot,  it's  usually  with  a
hypodermic, a needle that goes “under the skin” (see HYP/HYPO). A pachyderm is a “thick-skinned”
animal, which most of us just call an elephant.

- [[dermal]] 

 Relating to the skin and especially to the dermis. 

•  The  agency  is  always  studying  what  can  be  done  to  prevent  dermal  exposure  to  chemicals  in  the
workplace. 

The word dermal often comes up nowadays in connection with cosmetic treatments. Dermal therapy
usually means restoring moisture to dry, cracked skin. Dermal fillers such as collagen can be injected
to fill in acne scars or reduce wrinkles. These have now been joined by treatments like Botox, which
paralyzes facial dermal muscles, again in order to reduce wrinkles (since those dermal muscles are
used to form expressions). A synonym for dermal is cutaneous.

- [[epidermis]] 

 The outer layer of the skin. 

• The epidermis is the body's first line of defense against infection, external injury, and environmental
stresses. 

Epidermis includes the Greek prefix epi-, meaning “outer” (see EPI); thus, the epidermis overlies the
dermis, or inner layer of skin. The epidermis itself consists of four or five layers; the outermost layer
is made of dead cells, which are being shed continuously. The epidermis acts as a physical barrier—
a protective wrap over the body's surface, which, by preventing water loss, allows vertebrates to live
on land.

- [[taxidermist]] 

 One who prepares, stuffs, and mounts the skins of dead animals. 

•  The  taxidermist  suggested  that  the  bobcat  be  displayed  in  the  act  of  leaping  fiercely  toward  the
viewer. 

Taxidermists are called on not only by sportsmen and collectors but by museums, movie studios, and
advertisers.  Taxidermists  first  remove  the  skin  (with  its  fur,  hair,  or  feathers),  then  create  a  plaster
cast of the carcass with which to produce a “mannequin,” on which they replace the skin. Producing
trophies of lifelike quality that often recreate an exciting moment requires physical skill, attention to
detail, and sometimes artistic talent.

- [[dermatitis]] 

 Inflammation of the skin. 

• The only dermatitis she had ever suffered had been the result of playing in poison ivy when she was
little. 

Dermatitis  usually  appears  as  a  rash,  and  may  cause  itching,  blisters,  swelling,  and  often  scabbing
and  scaling.  It  often  marks  an  allergic  reaction  of  some  kind.  Contact  dermatitis  is  caused  by
something  (often  a  chemical)  touching  the  skin.  Atopic dermatitis  usually  affects  the  insides  of  the
elbows, the backs of the knees, and the face; generally resulting from an inherited sensitivity, it's often
triggered by inhaling something. Eczema, psoriasis, and dandruff are all forms of dermatitis. Even in
the worst cases, dermatitis isn't infectious and doesn't produce serious health consequences.

- ENDO  comes  from  the  Greek  endon,  meaning  “within.”  In  English  it  appears  almost  always  in
