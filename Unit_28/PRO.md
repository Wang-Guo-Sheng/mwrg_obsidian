- PRO  is  an  important  prefix,  with  a  couple  of  quite  different  broad  meanings.  In  this  section,  we'll
look at words in which pro- [[has]] the basic meaning “for” or “favoring.” Everyone knows words like
pro-democracy and pro-American, but other pro- [[words]] may not be quite so self-explanatory.

- [[proactive]] 

 Acting in anticipation of future problems, needs, or changes. 

•  Our  president  prides  himself  on  being  proactive,  and  is  always  imagining  situations  the  company
might be facing in three or four years. 

People who tend to react to a problem only when it's gotten serious could be called reactive people.
Until  recently,  reactive  (in  this  sense)  didn't  really  have  an  antonym.  So  proactive  was  coined  to
describe the kind of person who's always looking into the future in order to be prepared for anything.
A good parent attempts to be proactive on behalf of his or her children, trying to imagine the problems
they might be facing in a few months or years. A company's financial officers study the patterns of the
company's earnings to make sure it won't risk running short of cash at any point in the next year or
two.  Proactive  has  only  been  around  a  few  decades,  and  it  can  still  sometimes  sound  like  a
fashionable buzzword.

- [[pro]] bono 
donated for the public good. 

 Being, involved in, or doing professional work, and especially legal work,

• The law firm allows her to do several hours of pro bono work every week, and she devotes it to
helping poor immigrant families. 

In Latin, pro bono publico means “for the public good”; in English we generally shorten the phrase to
pro bono. Donating free legal help to those who need it has long been a practice of American law
firms;  the  American  Bar  Association  actually  recommends  that  all  lawyers  donate  50  hours  a  year.
Pro  bono  work  is  sometimes  donated  by  nonlegal  firms  as  well.  For  example,  an  advertising  firm
might  produce  a  60-second  video  for  an  environmental  or  educational  organization,  or  a  strategic-
planning firm might prepare a start-up plan for a charity that funds shelters for battered women.

- [[proponent]] 

 One who argues in favor of something: advocate. 

•  The  new  governor  is  a  proponent  of  a  longer  school  year,  and  he's  gotten  a  lot  of  support  from
parents. 

Proponent comes from the same Latin word as propose,  so  a  proponent  is  someone  who  proposes
something, or at least supports it by speaking and writing in favor of it. Thus, for example, proponents
of casinos argue that they create jobs, whereas proponents of a casino ban—that is, casino opponents
—argue that they're corrupting and they take money away from people who can't afford it. As a rule,
just about anything important that gets proposed also gets opposed.

- [[pro]]  forma 
meaning or importance. 

  Done  or  existing  as  something  that  is  required  but  that  has  little  true

• The letter she received from him after her husband's death struck her as pro forma, and she knew the
old friendship between the two men had never really been repaired. 

A  lot  of  things  are  done  for  the  sake  of  appearances.  A  teacher  might  get  officially  observed  and
evaluated every three years, even though everyone knows she's terrific and the whole thing is strictly
pro  forma.  A  critic  might  say  that  a  orchestral  conductor  gave  a  pro  forma  performance,  since  his
heart wasn't in it. A business owner might make a pro forma appearance at the funeral of a politician's
mother,  never  having  met  her  but  maybe  hoping  for  a  favor  from  her  son  sometime  in  the  future.  In
business, pro forma has some special meanings; a pro forma invoice, for example, will list all the
items being sent but, unlike a true invoice, won't be an actual bill.

- PRO, in its other broad meaning, means “before, in front of.” So, for example, to proceed means “to
move out in front”; to progress means to “to move forward”; and somebody prominent stands out, as
if he or she were actually standing out in front of the crowd.

- [[protrude]] 

 To jut out from the surrounding surface or context. 

•  As  he  leaned  over,  she  noticed  something  protruding  from  under  his  jacket,  and  realized  with  a
sickening feeling that he was armed. 

Since  trudere  means  “to  thrust”  in  Latin,  protrude  means  basically  “to  thrust  forward.”  If  your
neighbors'  patio  protrudes  over  your  property  boundary,  you  may  want  to  discuss  it  with  them.  A
protruding  disc  in  your  spine  may  have  to  be  operated  on  sooner  or  later;  superficial  protrusions,
such as corns or bunions, tend to be less serious than more deeply rooted ones.

- [[prophylaxis]] 
disease. 

  Measures  designed  to  preserve  health  and  prevent  the  spread  of

• For rabies, prophylaxis in the form of vaccines for cats and dogs is much better than treating them
after being bitten. 

In  Greek,  phylax  means  “guard,”  so  prophylactic  measures  guard  against  disease  by  taking  action
ahead  of  time.  Thus,  for  example,  before  the  polio  vaccine  became  available,  prophylaxis  against
polio  included  avoiding  crowds  and  public  swimming  pools.  These  days  a  well-known  kind  of
prophylactic is used to prevent sexually transmitted diseases; but prophylactic measures only work
when people use them.

- [[promulgate]] 

 (1) To proclaim or make public. (2) To put (a law) into effect. 

• The country's new constitution was officially promulgated in a grand ceremony at the presidential
palace. 

All  laws  need  to  be  made  public  in  some  way  so  that  citizens  may  know  if  they're  in  danger  of
breaking  them.  Since  they  can't  be  expected  to  go  into  effect  until  the  population  knows  they  exist,
promulgate  has  the  two  meanings  “proclaim”  and  “put  into  effect.”  In  ancient  Greece  and  Rome,
when most people couldn't read, a new written law would actually be proclaimed in a public place;
we've all seen such scenes in historical movies. But today promulgation of a law generally occurs
simply  by  its  being  published  in  an  official  government  publication  and  on  a  government  Web  site.
New laws are also often reported in newspapers and on TV, though rarely in complete form.

- [[prologue]] 
development. 

  (1)  An  introduction  to  a  literary  work.  (2)  An  introductory  event  or

• The Boston Tea Party of 1773 turned out to be a prologue to the American Revolution. 

In  ancient  Greek  drama,  the  prologos  (a  word  that  means  basically  “speaking  before”)  was  the
opening portion of the play, before the entry of the all-important chorus. It might be spoken by a single
actor, maybe playing a god, who would “set the scene” for the audience. Playwrights today instead
often provide the same kind of “scene-setting” information through dialogue near the play's beginning;
in  movies,  it  may  appear  (as  in  the  “Star  Wars”  series)  in  the  form  of  actual  written  text.  In  a
nonfiction book, the lead-in is now usually called a preface or introduction; novels rarely provide
any  introduction  at  all.  Still,  prologue  remains  a  useful  word  for  nonliterary  purposes.  The  saying
“The past is prologue” tells us that, in real life, almost everything can be a prologue to what follows
it.
