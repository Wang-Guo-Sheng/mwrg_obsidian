- PED comes from the Latin word for “foot.” A pedal is pushed by the foot; a pedicure is a treatment of
the feet, toes, and toenails; and a pedestal is what a statue stands on—in a sense, its foot.

- [[quadruped]] 

 An animal having four feet. 

• She always tells her friends that their farm has five kinds of quadrupeds: sheep, goats, cows, horses,
and pigs. 

The  quadrupeds  include  almost  all  the  mammals.  (Among  the  exceptions  are  whales,  bats,  and
humans.) The Greek equivalent of this Latin word is tetrapod. However, the two are not identical,
since  the  tetrapod  classification  includes  bipeds  such  as  birds,  in  which  two  of  the  limbs  are  no
longer  used  for  walking.  Insects  all  have  six  legs,  of  course,  and  in  the  sea  there  are  eight-legged
octopods (including the octopus). But there are no animals of any kind with an odd number of legs.

- [[pedigree]] 

 The line of ancestors of a person or animal. 

•  She  talks  a  lot  about  her  pedigree,  but  never  mentions  that  a  couple  of  her  uncles  spent  time  in
prison. 

What does someone's ancestry have to do with feet? Because someone once thought that a family tree,
or  genealogical  chart,  resembled  a  crane's  foot  (in  French,  pied de grue),  even  though  cranes'  feet
only have four talons or claws, no more than any other bird, while a family tree may have hundreds of
branches. The word pedigree  is  usually  used  for  purebred  animals—cats,  racehorses,  and  dogs,  as
well as livestock such as cows and sheep. Some people continue to believe that “purity” in human
family trees is a good thing as well, though most of us find the idea a little creepy.

- [[impediment]] 

 Something that interferes with movement or progress. 

• Her poorly developed verbal ability was the most serious impediment to her advancement. 

Impediment comes from a Latin verb that meant “to interfere with” or “to get in the way of progress,”
as if by tripping up the feet of someone walking. In English, impediment still suggests an obstruction
or  obstacle  along  a  path;  for  example,  a  lack  of  adequate  roads  and  bridges  would  be  called  an
impediment to economic development. Impediments usually get in the way of something we want. So
we may speak of an impediment to communication, marriage, or progress—but something that slows
the progress of aging, disease, or decay is rarely called an impediment.

- [[pedestrian]] 

 Commonplace, ordinary, or unimaginative. 

•  While  politicians  endlessly  discussed  the  great  issues  facing  Russia,  the  Russians  worried  about
such pedestrian concerns as finding enough food, shelter, and clothing. 

Most of us know pedestrian as a noun meaning someone who travels on foot. But the adjective sense
of pedestrian  as  defined  here  is  actually  its  original  meaning.  To  be  pedestrian  was  to  be  drab  or
dull, as if plodding along on foot rather than speeding on horseback or by coach. Pedestrian is often
used  to  describe  a  colorless  or  lifeless  writing  style,  but  it  can  also  describe  politicians,  public
tastes,  personal  qualities,  or  possessions.  In  comparison  with  the  elaborate  stage  shows  put  on  by
today's rock artists, for instance, most of the stage presentations of 1960s rock stars seem pedestrian.
