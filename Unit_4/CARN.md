- CARN comes from a Latin word meaning “flesh” or “meat.” Carnation originally meant “the color of
flesh,” which was once the only color of the flower we call the carnation. In Christian countries, Lent
is the period when the faithful traditionally give up something they love, often meat. The days leading
up  to  Lent  are  known  as  the  carnival  season,  from  the  Italian  carnelevare,  later  shortened  to
carnevale, which meant “removal of meat”—though during carnival, of course, people indulge in just
about everything, and the removal of meat only comes later.

- [[carnage]] 

 Great destruction of life (as in a battle); slaughter. 

• Countries around the world appealed to all sides of the conflict to stop the carnage of the war in
Bosnia. 

This word was taken over straight from French (a Latin-based language), and has mostly referred to
large-scale killing in wartime. But carnage needn't refer only to slaughter on the battlefield. With tens
of thousands of people dying each year in automobile accidents, it's appropriate to speak of carnage
on the nation's highways. And those concerned about the effects of the violence we see constantly on
TV and movie screens may refer to that as carnage as well.

- [[carnal]] 

 Having to do with bodily pleasures. 

• The news stories about students on Spring Break tend to focus on the carnal pleasures associated
with the annual ritual. 

In Christianity in past centuries, carnal was often used as the opposite of spiritual, describing what
are sometimes called “the pleasures of the flesh.” Thus, gluttony—the consumption of excessive food
and drink—was a deadly carnal sin, whereas the holiest monks and hermits might eat hardly anything
and  never  touch  wine.  Today  carnal  has  a  somewhat  old-fashioned  sound;  when  we  use  it,  we
generally mean simply “sexual.”

- [[incarnate]] 

 Given bodily or actual form; especially, having human body. 

• For the rest of his life, he would regard his childhood nanny as goodness incarnate. 

Incarnate often has a religious ring to it, since for centuries it has been used in the Christian church,
which regards Jesus as the incarnation  of  God—that  is,  as  God  made  human.  Surprisingly,  neither
word  appears  in  Bible  translations;  instead,  the  Latin  word  incarnatus  appears  in  the  Christian
creeds (basic statements of belief) and the Catholic Mass. Regardless, incarnate  soon  began  to  be
used with various nouns: “the devil incarnate,” “evil incarnate,” etc. Notice that incarnate is one of
the rare adjectives that usually, but not always, follows its noun. Incarnate is also a verb, though with
a slightly different pronunciation: “This report simply incarnates the prejudices of its authors,” “For
her followers, she incarnates the virtue of selflessness,” etc.

- [[reincarnation]] 
has been born again with a new body after death. 

 (1) Rebirth in new bodies or forms of life. (2) Someone who

• Even as a child he struck everyone as a reincarnation of his grandfather, not in his features but in his
manner and personality. 

It's easy to make fun of people who claim to be the reincarnation of Cleopatra or Napoleon, but they
don't  come  from  a  culture  that  takes  reincarnation  seriously.  In  Hindu  belief,  a  person  must  pass
through a series of reincarnations—some of which may be as insects or fish—before fully realizing
that  the  bodily  pleasures  are  shallow  and  that  only  spiritual  life  is  truly  valuable;  only  then  do  the
reincarnations cease. For Hindus, an “old soul” is a person who seems unusually wise from early in
life, and whose wisdom must have come from passing through many reincarnations.
