VOR  comes  from  the  Latin  verb  vorare,  “to  eat,”  and  the  ending  -ivorous  shows  up  in  words  that
refer  to  eaters  of  certain  kinds  of  food.  Frugivorous  (for  “fruit-eating”),  granivorous  (for  “grain-
eating”),  and  graminivorous  (for  “grass-eating”)  aren't  too  rare,  but  you  won't  run  across
phytosuccivorous (“plant-sap-eating”) every day.

- [[carnivorous]] 

 Meat-eating or flesh-eating. 

• He'd gotten tired of his vegetarian guinea pigs and decided he preferred carnivorous pets such as
ferrets. 

The  order  of  mammals  that  Linnaeus  named  the  Carnivora  includes  such  families  as  the  dogs,  the
bears, the raccoons, the weasels, the hyenas, the cats, and the seals. Most carnivores eat only meat in
the wild, but some have varied diets; some bears, for instance, normally eat far more vegetation than
meat.  Carnivores  have  powerful  jaws  and  complex  teeth,  and  most  are  highly  intelligent.  Humans,
like their ape cousins, are basically omnivores (see omnivore).

- [[herbivorous]] 

 Plant-eating. 

• In spite of their frightening appearance, marine iguanas are peaceable herbivorous animals that feed
mostly on seaweed. 

Many  herbivorous  animals,  such  as  rabbits,  deer,  sheep,  and  cows,  are  noted  for  their  gentle  and
passive ways. But such behavior is not universal among herbivores. Rhinoceroses and elephants, for
instance, are capable of inflicting serious damage if threatened, and among dinosaurs, the herbivorous
Diplodocus  had  a  thick  tail  that  could  be  used  as  a  lethal  weapon  against  attacking  carnivores.
Herbivorous humans are usually called vegetarians.

- [[insectivorous]] 

 Feeding on insects. 

• Their rather odd 12-year-old son kept insectivorous plants in his bedroom and fed them live flies. 

A wide variety of animals could be called insectivores—most of the birds, for example, as well as
the spiders. Of the amphibians, frogs and many lizards are largely insectivorous. Even some fish get
much of their food from insects. The order of mammals called Insectivora contains the shrews, moles,
and  hedgehogs,  though  bats  and  anteaters  are  also  insectivores.  Many  insects  are  themselves
insectivores; the dragonfly, for instance, is a swift insectivorous terror that lives up to its name. But
it's the insectivorous plants that tend to fascinate us; of the over 600 species, the best known are the
Venus flytrap (which snaps shut on its prey), the pitcher plants (which drown insects in a tiny pool of
water), and the sundews (which capture insects with their sticky surfaces).

- [[voracious]] 

 Having a huge appetite. 

•  One  of  the  hardest  parts  of  dieting  is  watching  skinny  people  with  voracious  appetites  consume
large amounts of food without gaining weight. 

Voracious can be applied to people, animals, and even things, and doesn't always refer to consuming
food.  Thus,  teenagers  are  voracious  eaters;  you  may  become  a  voracious  reader  on  vacation;  and
Americans have long been voracious consumers. The most voracious bats may eat three-quarters of
their weight in insects in a single night. Some countries have a voracious appetite for oil. Voracious
corporations keep “swallowing” other companies through mergers.

- CARN comes from a Latin word meaning “flesh” or “meat.” Carnation originally meant “the color of
