- FID  comes  from  fides,  the  Latin  word  for  “faith”  or  “trust.”  Fidelity  is  another  word  for
“faithfulness.” Confidence is having faith in someone or something. An infidel is someone who lacks
a particular kind of religious faith. And the once-popular dog's name Fido is Latin for “I trust.”

- [[affidavit]] 

 A sworn statement made in writing. 

• The whole family had signed affidavits stating that they believed the will to be valid. 

In Latin, affidavit  means  “he  (she)  has  sworn  an  oath,”  and  an  affidavit  is  always  a  sworn  written
document.  If  it  contains  a  lie,  the  person  making  it  may  be  prosecuted.  Affidavits  are  often  used  in
court  when  it  isn't  possible  for  someone  to  appear  in  person.  Police  officers  must  usually  file  an
affidavit  with  a  judge  to  get  a  search  warrant.  Affidavits  (unlike  similar  signed  statements  called
depositions) are usually made without an opposing lawyer being present and able to ask questions.

- [[diffident]] 

 Lacking confidence; timid, cautious. 

• He always found it a struggle to get his most diffident students to speak in front of the class. 

Diffident means lacking faith in oneself—in other words, the opposite of confident. Distrust in your
abilities  or  opinions  usually  makes  you  hesitate  to  speak  or  act.  Patients  who  feel  diffident  around
their  doctors,  for  example,  don't  dare  ask  them  many  questions.  A  helpful  friend  tries  to  instill
confidence in place of diffidence.

- [[fiduciary]] 

 (1) Having to do with a confidence or trust. (2) Held in trust for another.

•  Pension-fund  managers  have  a  fiduciary  responsibility  to  invest  the  pension's  funds  for  the  sole
benefit of those who will receive the pensions. 

A  fiduciary  relationship  is  one  in  which  one  person  places  faith  in  another.  Stockbrokers  and  real-
estate  agents  have  fiduciary  duties  to  their  clients,  which  means  they  must  act  in  their  clients'  best
financial  interests.  Members  of  a  company's  board  of  directors  have  a  fiduciary  responsibility  to
protect the financial interests of the company's shareholders. There are legal requirements for those
with fiduciary responsibility, and they can be sued for breach of fiduciary duty if they fail.

- [[perfidy]] 

 Faithlessness, disloyalty, or treachery. 

• While working for the CIA he was lured into becoming a double agent, and it seems he paid a high
price for his perfidy. 

The perfidious Benedict Arnold plotted with the British to surrender West Point to them during the
American Revolution—an act that made his name a synonym for traitor. In recent years, the perfidy
of  the  double  agents  Aldrich  Ames  (of  the  CIA)  and  Robert  Hanssen  (of  the  FBI)  has  become
notorious.
