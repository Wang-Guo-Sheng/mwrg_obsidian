- CRED  comes  from  credere,  the  Latin  verb  meaning  “to  believe”  or  “to  entrust.”  We  have  a  good
credit  rating  when  institutions  trust  in  our  ability  to  repay  a  loan,  and  we  carry  credentials  so  that
others will believe that we are who we say we are.

- [[credence]] 

 Mental acceptance of something as true or real; belief. 

• He scoffed and said no one still gives any credence to the story of the Loch Ness monster. 

Credence is close in meaning to belief, but there are differences. Unlike belief, credence is seldom
used in connection with faith in a religion or philosophy. Instead credence is often used in reference
to reports, rumors, and opinions. And, unlike belief,  it  tends  to  be  used  with  the  words  give,  lack,
lend,and gain.  So  a  new  piece  of  evidence  may  lend  credence  to  the  alibi  of  a  criminal  suspect.
Claims that a political candidate can become the next President gain credence only after the candidate
wins a few primaries. And although stories about Elvis sightings persist, they lack credence for most
people.

- [[credible]] 
effective. 

 (1) Able to be believed; reasonable to trust or believe. (2) Good enough to be

• Because of her past criminal record, the defense lawyers knew she wouldn't be a credible witness. 

Credible evidence is evidence that's likely to be believed. A credible plan is one that might actually
work, and a credible excuse is one your parents might actually believe. And just as credible means
“believable,” the noun credibility means “believability.” (But we no longer use incredible to mean
the  literal  opposite  of  credible,  just  as  we  no  longer  use  unbelievable  as  the  literal  opposite  of
believable.) Since cred is short for credibility, “street cred” is the kind of credibility among tough
young people that you can only get by proving yourself on the mean streets of the inner city.

- [[credulity]] 

 Readiness and willingness to believe on the basis of little evidence. 

• Thrillers and action movies only succeed if they don't strain our credulity too much. 

A particularly far-fetched story may be said to strain credulity, stretch credulity, put demands on our
credulity, or make claims on our credulity. Credulity is a quality of innocent children (of all ages) and
isn't  always  a  bad  thing;  it  must  have  been  pure  credulity  that  enabled  Chicago  White  Sox  and
Philadelphia Phillies fans to wait so long for a World Series victory (“This is the year they're going
to take it!”), which probably made life bearable for them. The related adjective is credulous. F. Scott
Fitzgerald once defined advertising as “making dubious promises to a credulous public.”

- [[credo]] 
principles or beliefs. 

  (1)  A  statement  of  the  basic  beliefs  of  a  religious  faith.  (2)  A  set  of  guiding

• She claims she made her money on Wall Street just by following the old credo “Buy low, sell high.” 

Credo comes straight from the Latin word meaning “I believe,” and is the first word of many religious
credos, or creeds, such as the Apostles' Creed and the Nicene Creed. But the word can be applied to
any guiding principle or set of principles. Of course, you may choose a different credo when you're
52 than when you're 19. But here is the credo of the writer H. L. Mencken, written after he had lived
quite a few years: “I believe that it is better to tell the truth than to lie. I believe that it is better to be
free than to be a slave. And I believe that it is better to know than to be ignorant.”

- FID  comes  from  fides,  the  Latin  word  for  “faith”  or  “trust.”  Fidelity  is  another  word  for
