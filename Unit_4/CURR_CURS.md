- CURR/CURS comes from currere, the Latin verb meaning “to run.” Although words based on this
root  don't  tend  to  suggest  speed,  the  sense  of  movement  remains.  Current,  for  instance,  refers  to
running water in a stream or river, or electrons running through a wire, and an excursion is a trip from
one place to another.

- [[concurrent]] 

 Happening or operating at the same time. 

• The killer was sentenced to serve three concurrent life terms in prison. 

Things that are concurrent usually not only happen at the same time but also are similar to each other.
So, for example, multitasking computers are capable of performing concurrent tasks. When we take
more than one medication at a time, we run the risks involved with concurrent drug use. And at any
multiplex theater several movies are running concurrently.

- [[cursory]] 

 Hastily and often carelessly done. 

• Having spent the weekend going to parties, she had only given the chapter a cursory reading before
class on Monday. 

Unlike the other words in this section, cursory always implies speed. But it also stresses a lack of
attention to detail. Cursory observations are generally shallow or superficial because of their speed.
And when citizens complain about a cursory police investigation of a crime, they're distressed by its
lack of thoroughness, not its speed.

- [[discursive]] 

 Passing from one topic to another. 

•  Some  days  he  allowed  himself  to  write  long  discursive  essays  in  his  diary  instead  of  his  usual
simple reporting of the day's events. 

The  Latin  verb  discurrere  meant  “to  run  about,”  and  from  this  word  we  get  our  word  discursive,
which often means rambling about over a wide range of topics. A discursive writing style generally
isn't  encouraged  by  writing  teachers.  But  some  of  the  great  19th-century  writers,  such  as  Charles
Lamb and Thomas de Quincey, show that the discursive essay, especially when gracefully written and
somewhat personal in tone, can be a pleasure to read. And the man often called the inventor of the
essay, the great Michel de Montaigne, might touch on dozens of different topics in the course of a long
discursive essay.

- [[precursor]] 

 One that goes before and indicates the coming of another. 

• Scientists are trying to identify special geological activity that may be a precursor to an earthquake,
which will help them predict the quake's size, time, and location. 

With its prefix pre-, meaning “before,” a precursor is literally a “forerunner,” and in fact forerunner
first appeared as the translation of the Latin praecursor. But the two words function a little differently
today. A forerunner may simply come before another thing, but a precursor generally paves the way
for something. So, for example, the Office of Strategic Services in World War II was the immediate
precursor of today's Central Intelligence Agency, while the blues music of the 1930s and 1940s was
only one of the precursors of the rock and roll of today.

- PED comes from the Latin word for “foot.” A pedal is pushed by the foot; a pedicure is a treatment of
