- FLECT comes from flectere, the Latin verb meaning “to bend.” The root sometimes takes the form
flex-. Things that are flexible can be bent, and when you flex a muscle, you're usually bending a limb
—which, as a trainer at the gym will tell you, requires the use of flexor muscles.

- [[deflect]] 

 To turn aside, especially from a straight or fixed course. 

• The stealth technology used on bombers and fighter jets works by deflecting radar energy, making
them “invisible.” 

Use  of  the  physical  meaning  of  deflect  is  common.  Thus,  a  soccer  goalie's  save  might  involve
deflecting the ball rather than catching it, and workers wear eye shields to deflect tiny particles flying
out of machines. But the nonphysical meaning may be even more common. A Hollywood actress might
deflect criticism about her personal life by giving lavishly to charity, for example, and we've all tried
to change the subject to deflect a question we really didn't want to answer.

- [[reflective]] 

 (1) Capable of reflecting light, images, or sound waves. (2) Thoughtful. 

•  He  likes  action  movies  and  going  out  drinking  with  friends,  but  when  you  get  to  know  him  you
realize he's basically reflective and serious. 

Reflective people are people who reflect on things—that is, look back at things that have been done
or  said  in  order  to  think  calmly  and  quietly  about  them.  Most  reflective  people  would  agree  with
Socrates that (as he told the jury that would soon sentence him to death) “The unexamined life is not
worth living.” Reflective people tend to be a bit philosophical and intellectual. But almost everyone
has reflective moods; gazing into a fireplace or a campfire seems to do it to almost everyone.

- [[genuflect]] 

 To kneel on one knee and then rise as an act of respect. 

•  At  religious  shrines  in  China,  pilgrims  may  not  only  genuflect  but  actually  lie  down  flat  on  the
ground. 

Genuflection, which contains the root genu-, “knee,” has long been a mark of respect and obedience.
King Arthur's Knights of the Round Table genuflected not only when he knighted them but whenever
they greeted him formally, and this custom remains in countries today that are still ruled by royalty. In
some churches, each worshipper is expected to genuflect whenever entering or leaving a pew on the
central aisle.

- [[inflection]] 
form of a word showing its case, gender, number, person, tense, mood, voice, or comparison. 

 (1) A change in the pitch, tone, or loudness of the voice. (2) The change in

• She couldn't understand her grandfather's words, but she knew from his inflection that he was asking
a question. 

Changing  the  pitch,  tone,  or  loudness  of  our  words  are  ways  we  communicate  meaning  in  speech,
though  not  on  the  printed  page.  A  rising  inflection  at  the  end  of  a  sentence  generally  indicates  a
question, and a falling inflection indicates a statement, for example. Another way of inflecting words
is by adding endings: -s  to  make  a  noun  plural,  -ed  to  put  a  verb  in  the  past  tense,  -er  to  form  the
comparative form of an adjective, and so on.

- POST  comes  from  a  Latin  word  meaning  “after”  or  “behind.”  A  postscript  (or  PS)  is  a  note  that
