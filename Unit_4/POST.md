- POST  comes  from  a  Latin  word  meaning  “after”  or  “behind.”  A  postscript  (or  PS)  is  a  note  that
comes after an otherwise completed letter, usually as an afterthought. Postpartum refers to the period
following childbirth, with any related events and complications. To postdate a check is to give it a
date after the day it was written.

- [[posterior]] 

 Situated toward or on the back; rear. 

• In a human posterior and dorsal can both refer to the back, but in a fish posterior refers to the tail
area. 

Posterior comes from the Latin word posterus, meaning “coming after.” Posterior is often used as a
technical  term  in  biology  and  medicine  to  refer  to  the  back  side  of  things,  and  is  the  opposite  of
anterior,  which  refers  to  the  front  side.  For  example,  as  more  people  took  up  running  as  a  sport,
doctors began to see an increase in stress fractures along the posterior as well as the anterior surface
of the lower leg bones. In some technical fields, posterior may mean “later.” When used as a noun,
posterior simply means “buttocks.”

- [[posthumous]] 
after one's death. 

 (1) Published after the death of the author. (2) Following or happening

• Though Van Gogh scarcely sold a single painting during his lifetime, he rose to posthumous fame as
one of the world's great artists. 

Posthumous fame is fame that comes a little late. In fact, its original meaning in English is “born after
the death of the father.” Bill Clinton was the posthumous son of a father who died in an automobile
accident. The word is now mostly used of artistic works that appear after the death of the artist, or the
changing reputation of a dead artist. Such posthumous works as Herman Melville's Billy Budd,  the
diary  of  Anne  Frank,  and  almost  all  the  poetry  of  Emily  Dickinson  have  become  legendary,  and  in
each case they had a major influence on the writer's reputation.

- [[postmodern]] 
 Having to do with a movement in architecture, art, or literature that is
a  reaction  against  modernism  and  that  reintroduces  traditional  elements  and  techniques  in  odd
contexts as well as elements from popular culture. 

• The postmodern AT&T building in New York, with the “Chippendale” top that reminds viewers of
an antique dresser, aroused a storm of criticism. 

With  its  prefix  post-,  postmodern  describes  a  movement  that  has  reacted  against  modernism.
Modernism,  dating  from  around  the  start  of  the  20th  century,  represented  a  sharp  break  from  19th-
century styles. But in the 1970s architects began to be dissatisfied with the stark simplicity of most
modern architecture and began including in their mostly modern designs such traditional elements as
columns, arches, and keystones and sometimes startling color contrasts such as might have come from
advertising and pop culture. In art and literature, as in architecture, postmodernism often seems to be
making  fun  of  tradition,  especially  by  denying  that  there's  any  real  distinction  between  serious  and
popular art or writing. Wherever it has shown up, postmodernism has been greeted with a mixture of
approval, disapproval, and sometimes amusement.

- [[postmortem]] 

 (1) Occurring after death. (2) Following the event. 

•  In  their  postmortem  discussion  of  the  election,  the  reporters  tried  to  explain  how  the  polls  and
predictions could have been so completely wrong. 

Post  mortem  is  Latin  for  “after  death.”  In  English,  postmortem  refers  to  an  examination,
investigation,  or  process  that  takes  place  after  death.  A  postmortem  examination  of  a  body  (often
simply called a postmortem) is often needed to determine the time and cause of death; the stiffening
called rigor mortis is one postmortem change that doctors look at to determine when death occurred.
Today we've come to use postmortem to refer to any examination or discussion that takes place after
an event.

- Words from Mythology

calypso 
words that are often made up by the singer. 

 A folk song or style of singing of West Indian origin that has a lively rhythm and

•  If  you  take  a  Caribbean  vacation  in  December,  you  end  up  listening  to  a  lot  of  Christmas  carols
played to a calypso beat. 

In Homer's Odyssey, the nymph Calypso detains Odysseus for seven years on his way home from the
Trojan War, using all her wiles to hold him on her lush island. For many people, the calypso music of
the  West  Indian  islands,  which  was  eventually  brought  to  America  by  singers  such  as  the  Andrews
Sisters and later Harry Belafonte, has some of the same captivating power as the nymph, though the
lyrics that are often improvised to the melodies tend to make fun of local people and happenings. The
original  name  for  these  songs,  however,  actually  seems  to  be  based  on  a  similar-sounding  African
word,  for  which,  early  in  the  20th  century,  someone  began  substituting  this  name  from  Greek
mythology.

- [[odyssey]] 
journey or quest. 

  (1)  A  long,  wandering  journey  full  of  trials  and  adventures.  (2)  A  spiritual

• Their six-month camping trip around the country was an odyssey they would always remember. 

Odysseus, the hero of Homer's Odyssey, spends 20 years traveling home from the Trojan War. He has
astonishing adventures and learns a great deal about himself and the world; he even descends to the
underworld to talk to the dead. Thus, an odyssey is any long, complicated journey, often a quest for a
goal, and may be a spiritual or psychological journey as well as an actual voyage.

- [[palladium]] 
electrical contacts and as an alloy with gold to form white gold. 

  A  precious,  silver-white  metal  related  to  platinum  that  is  used  in

• Most wedding rings today are simple bands of gold, platinum, or palladium. 

Pallas  Athena  was  one  of  the  poetical  names  given  to  the  Greek  goddess  Athena  (although  it's  no
longer clear what Pallas was supposed to mean), and the original palladium was a statue of Athena
that was believed to have the power to protect the ancient city of Troy. When an asteroid belt was
discovered  between  Mars  and  Jupiter,  most  of  the  asteroids  were  named  after  figures  in  Greek
mythology,  and  one  of  the  first  to  be  discovered  was  named  Pallas  in  1803.  In  the  same  year,
scientists isolated a new silvery metal element, which they named palladium in honor of the recently
discovered asteroid.

- Penelope 

 A modest domestic wife. 

• Critics of Hillary Rodham Clinton in the 1990s would perhaps have preferred her to be a Penelope,
quietly tending the White House and staying out of politics. 

In the Odyssey, Penelope waits 20 long years for her husband Odysseus to return from Troy. During
that time, she must raise their son and fend off the attentions of numerous rough suitors. She preserves
herself for a long time by saying she cannot remarry until she has finished weaving a funeral shroud
for her aging father-in-law; however, what she weaves each day she secretly unravels each night. A
Penelope  thus  appears  to  be  the  perfect,  patient,  faithful  wife  (and  may  be  using  her  clever
intelligence to keep herself that way).

- [[procrustean]] 
circumstances. 

  Ruthlessly  disregarding 

individual  differences  or  special

• The school's procrustean approach seemed to assume that all children learned in the same way and
at the same rate. 

In  the  Greek  tale  of  the  hero  Theseus,  Procrustes  was  a  bandit  who  ambushed  travelers  and,  after
robbing them, made them lie on an iron bed. To make sure they “fit” this bed, he would cut off the
parts  that  hung  off  the  ends  or  stretch  the  body  if  it  was  too  short;  either  way,  the  unlucky  traveler
always died. When he made the mistake of confronting Theseus, Procrustes was made to “fit” his own
bed.  Something  procrustean  takes  no  account  of  individual  differences  but  cruelly  and  mercilessly
makes everything the same.

- [[protean]] 
forms or natures. 

 (1) Displaying great versatility or variety. (2) Able to take on many different

•  A  protean  athlete,  he  left  college  with  offers  from  the  professional  leagues  to  play  baseball,
football, and basketball. 

As the story is told in the Odyssey, at the end of the Trojan War the sea god Proteus revealed to King
Menelaus of Sparta how to get home from Troy with his unfaithful wife, the beautiful Helen of Troy.
Before Proteus would give up the information, though, Menelaus had to capture him—no mean feat,
since Proteus had the ability to change into any natural shape he chose. The word protean came to
describe  this  ability  to  change  into  many  different  shapes  or  to  play  many  different  roles  in  quick
succession.

- [[sibyl]] 

 A female prophet or fortune-teller. 

• The villagers told him about an aged woman who lived alone in a hut on a nearby mountain, a sibyl
who knew the future and would prophesy under the right conditions. 

Ancient writers refer to the existence of various women in such countries as Babylonia, Greece, Italy,
and  Egypt,  through  whom  the  gods  regularly  spoke.  These  sibyls  were  easy  to  confuse  with  the
oracles,  women  who  were  likewise  mouthpieces  of  the  gods,  at  such  sites  as  Apollo's  temple  at
Delphi. The most famous sibyl was the Sibyl of Cumae in Italy, a withered crone who lived in a cave.
Her  prophecies  were  collected  into  twelve  books,  three  of  which  survived  to  be  consulted  by  the
Romans  in  times  of  national  emergencies.  She  is  one  of  the  five  sibyls  memorably  depicted  by
Michelangelo on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel.

- [[siren]] 

 A woman who tempts men with bewitching sweetness. 

• Reporters treated her like a sex symbol, but she lacked the graceful presence and air of mystery of a
real siren. 

The  sirens  were  a  group  of  partly  human  female  creatures  that  lured  sailors  onto  destructive  rocks
with their singing. Odysseus and his men encountered the sirens on their long journey home from Troy.
The only way to sail by them safely was to make oneself deaf to their enchanting song, so Odysseus
packed the men's ears with wax, while he himself, ever curious, kept his ears open but had himself
tied  to  the  mast  to  keep  from  flinging  himself  into  the  water  or  steering  his  ship  toward  sure
destruction in his desire to see them. A siren today is a sinister but almost irresistible woman. A siren
song, however, may be any appeal that lures a person to act against his or her better judgment.
