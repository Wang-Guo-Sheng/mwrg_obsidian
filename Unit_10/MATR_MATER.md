- MATR/MATER comes from the Greek and Latin words for “mother.” A matron is a mature woman
with children. And matrimony is marriage itself, the traditional first step toward motherhood.

- [[maternity]] 

 The state of being a mother; motherhood. 

• It's quite possible that the Mona Lisa is a portrait of maternity, and that the painting marks the recent
birth of her child Andrea. 

Maternity is used as both a noun and an adjective. Maternity benefits are benefits specially provided
by  employers  for  women  having  babies,  and  usually  include  maternity leave,  time  off  work.  With
maternity come maternal feelings, which are shown by all species of warm-blooded animals as well
as a few reptiles such as crocodiles and alligators.

- [[matriarch]] 

 A woman who controls a family, group, or government. 

• Every August all the grown children and their families are summoned to the estate by the matriarch. 

A matriarchy  is  a  social  unit  governed  by  a  woman  or  group  of  women.  It  isn't  certain  that  a  true
matriarchal society has ever existed, so matriarchy is usually treated as an imaginative concept. But
there are societies in which relatedness through women rather than men is stressed, and elements of
matriarchy may be stronger in certain societies than they are in most of the Western world. And most
of  us  can  point  to  families  in  which  a  woman  has  become  the  dominant  figure,  or  grande  dame,  or
matriarch.

- [[matrilineal]] 

 Based on or tracing the family through the mother. 

• Many of the peoples of Ghana in Africa trace their family through matrilineal connections. 

A  person's  lineage  is  his  or  her  line  of  ancestors.  So  matrilineal  means  basically  “through  the
mother's  line,”  just  as  patrilineal  means  “through  the  father's  line.”  Matrilineality  is  an  important
concept  in  anthropology;  among  other  things,  it  usually  determines  who  will  inherit  property  on  a
person's  death.  Though  families  that  follow  the  European  model  take  the  father's  name  and  are
therefore  patrilineal,  matrilineal  societies  have  existed  around  the  world,  including  among  various
American Indian tribes.

- [[matrix]] 
develops or forms. (2) Something shaped like a pattern of lines and spaces. 

 (1) Something (such as a situation or a set of conditions) in which something else

•  The  country's  political  matrix  is  so  complex  that  no  one  who  hasn't  lived  there  could  possibly
understand it. 

In  ancient  Rome,  a  matrix  was  a  female  animal  kept  for  breeding,  or  a  plant  (sometimes  called  a
“parent plant” or “mother plant”) whose seeds were used for producing other plants. In English the
word  has  taken  on  many  related  meanings.  Mathematicians  use  it  for  a  rectangular  organization  of
numbers  or  symbols  that  can  be  used  to  make  various  calculations;  geologists  use  it  for  the  soil  or
rock in which a fossil is discovered, like a baby in the womb. And matrix was a good choice as the
name of the reality in which all humans find themselves living in a famous series of science-fiction
films.

- AQU comes from aqua, the Latin word for “water.” We keep pet fish in an aquarium at home or visit
