- AQU comes from aqua, the Latin word for “water.” We keep pet fish in an aquarium at home or visit
larger sea animals in a building with that name. Water sports such as swimming, canoeing, and sailing
are  sometimes  called  aquatics.  In  Scandinavia  there's  a  popular  drink  called  aquavit,  the  name
coming  from  the  Latin  aqua  vitae,  “water  of  life”—though  instead  of  water  it  mostly  consists  of
alcohol.

- [[aquaculture]] 
that live in the water. 

 The farming of plants and animals (such as kelp, fish, and shellfish)

•  The  farming  of  oysters  by  the  Romans  was  an  early  form  of  aquaculture  that  has  continued  to  the
present day. 

For most of the modern history of aquaculture, only costly fish and shellfish like salmon and shrimp
were harvested. But new technologies are allowing cheaper and more efficient cultivation of fish for
food, and such common fish as cod are now being farmed. Seaweeds and other algae are also being
grown—for  food  (mostly  in  Asia),  cattle  feed,  fertilizer,  and  experimentally  as  a  source  of  energy.
Aquaculture is now the world's fastest-growing form of food production.

- [[aquanaut]] 
shelter for an extended time. 

 A scuba diver who lives and works both inside and outside an underwater

• Each scientist at the laboratory spent two weeks a year as an aquanaut living in the deep-sea station.

Aquanaut combines aqua with the Greek nautes, meaning “sailor.” Like astronaut and aeronaut, the
word may remind you of those mythical Greek heroes known as the Argonauts, who sailed with Jason
on his ship, the Argo, in quest of the Golden Fleece. Various underwater habitats for aquanauts, such
as Conshelf, SEALAB, and MarineLab, have captured the public imagination since the 1960s.

- [[aqueduct]] 
water over a valley. 

  (1)  A  pipe  or  channel  for  water.  (2)  A  bridgelike  structure  for  carrying

• Roman aqueducts were built throughout the empire, and their spectacular arches can still be seen in
Greece, France, Spain, and North Africa. 

Based party on the Latin ducere, meaning “lead” or “conduct” (see DUC/DUCT), the word aqueduct
named an ancient civil-engineering marvel. You may have seen photos of the great arches of ancient
aqueducts spanning valleys in countries throughout the old Roman Empire, practical pipelines that are
also  regarded  as  works  of  timeless  beauty.  From  the  20th  century,  the  242-mile  Colorado  River
Aqueduct,  the  336-mile  Central  Arizona  Project,  and  the  444-mile  California  Aqueduct  are
considered  wonders  of  American  engineering,  but  they  are  not  renowned  for  their  beauty.  Most
aqueducts today either are riverlike channels or run underground, perhaps appearing simply as a long
mound.

- [[aquifer]] 

 A layer of rock, sand, or gravel that can absorb and hold water. 

• Cities without access to a nearby lake or river must rely on underground aquifers to meet their water
needs. 

The vast but relatively shallow Ogallala Aquifer lies beneath the Great Plains, under portions of eight
states. Its thickness ranges from a few feet to more than a thousand feet. The Ogallala yields about 30
percent of the nation's groundwater used for irrigation in agriculture, and provides drinking water for
most  of  the  people  within  the  area.  But  for  many  years  more  water  has  been  extracted  from  the
Ogallala than has been returned, and the situation today is of great concern.

Answers

- Words from Mythology

cereal 
(2) The food made from grain. 

 (1) A plant that produces grain that can be eaten as food, or the grain it produces.

• Rice is the main food cereal of Asia, whereas wheat and corn are the main food cereals of the West.

The Roman goddess Ceres, the equivalent of the Greek Demeter, was a calm goddess who didn't take
part in the quarrels of the other gods. Her particular responsibility was the food-giving plants, and for
that reason the food grains came to carry her name. Cereals of the ancient Romans included wheat,
barley, spelt, oats, and millet—but not corn (maize), which was a cereal of the Americas.

- Junoesque 

 Having mature, poised, and dignified beauty. 

•  In  1876,  as  a  centennial  gift,  the  French  sent  to  America  a  massive  statue  of  a  robed  Junoesque
figure representing Liberty, to be erected in New York Harbor. 

Juno was the wife of Jupiter, the chief of the Roman gods. As the first among goddesses, her power
gave  her  particular  dignity;  and  as  goddess  of  women  and  marriage,  she  was  a  mature  matron.  But
such younger goddesses as Diana, goddess of the hunt, perhaps came closer to today's ideals of slim
and athletic female beauty.

- [[martial]] 

 Having to do with war and military life. 

• The stirring, martial strains of “The British Grenadiers” echoed down the snowy street just as dawn
was breaking. 

Mars was the Roman god of war and one of the patron gods of Rome itself. He was responsible for
everything  military,  from  warriors  to  weapons  to  marching  music.  Thus,  martial arts  are  skills  of
combat  and  self-defense  also  practiced  as  sport.  When  martial law  is  declared,  a  country's  armed
forces take over the functions of the police. And a court-martial is a military court or trial.

- Promethean 

 New or creative in a daring way. 

• Beginning in the 1950s, the little Asian countries of South Korea, Taiwan, and Singapore began to
display a Promethean energy that would become one of the marvels of the modern world. 

Prometheus was a Titan, a generation older than Zeus. When Zeus overthrew his own father Cronus
and seized power, Prometheus fought on the side of the gods and against his fellow Titans. But when
Zeus later wanted to destroy the race of humans, Prometheus saved them by stealing fire for them from
the  gods.  He  also  taught  them  how  to  write,  farm,  build  houses,  read  the  stars  and  weather,  cure
themselves when sick, and tame animals—in short, all the arts and skills that make humans unique. So
inventive was he that anything of great creativity and originality can still be called Promethean. But
Prometheus had taken a terrible risk; enraged by his disobedience, Zeus had him chained to a rocky
cliff, where for many long centuries an eagle daily tore at his liver.

- Sisyphean 

 Endless and difficult, involving many disappointments. 

•  After  twenty  years,  many  researchers  had  begun  to  think  that  defeating  the  virus  was  a  Sisyphean
task that would never succeed. 

Reputedly  the  cleverest  man  on  earth,  King  Sisyphus  of  Corinth  tricked  the  gods  into  bringing  him
back  to  life  after  he  had  died.  For  this  they  punished  him  by  sending  him  back  to  the  underworld,
where he must eternally roll a huge rock up a long, steep hill, only to watch it roll back to where he
started.  Something  Sisyphean  demands  the  same  kind  of  unending,  thankless,  and  ultimately
unsuccessful efforts.

- [[titanic]] 

 Having great size, strength, or power; colossal. 

• The titanic floods of 1993 destroyed whole towns on the Mississippi River. 

In  Greek  mythology,  the  Titans  were  the  generation  of  giant  creators  that  produced  the  younger,
stronger, cleverer gods, who soon overpowered and replaced them (see Promethean above). In 1911
the largest ship that had ever been built was christened the Titanic for its unmatched size and strength.
But  the  name  may  have  proved  unlucky;  on  its  maiden  voyage  in  1912  a  massive  iceberg  ripped  a
fatal hole in the great ship, and it sank in the icy waters off Newfoundland.

- Triton 
Any of various large mollusks with a heavy, conical shell. 

 (1) A being with a human upper body and the lower body of a fish; a merman. (2)

• In one corner of the painting, a robust Triton emerges from the sea with his conch to announce the
coming of the radiant queen. 

Triton was originally the son of the sea god Poseidon (or Neptune). A guardian of the fish and other
creatures of the sea, he is usually shown as hearty, muscular, and cheerful. Like his father, he often
carries a trident (three-pronged fork) and may ride in a chariot drawn by seahorses. Blowing on his
conch  shell,  he  creates  the  roar  of  the  ocean.  As  a  decorative  image,  Tritons  are  simply  the  male
version of mermaids. The handsome seashells that bear their name are the very conchs on which they
blow. Triton has also given his name to the planet Neptune's largest moon.

- [[vulcanize]] 
strong and resists decay. 

 To treat crude or synthetic rubber or plastic so that it becomes elastic and

•  The  native  islanders  had  even  discovered  how  to  vulcanize  the  rubber  from  the  local  trees  in  a
primitive way. 

The  Roman  god  Vulcan  (the  Greek  Hephaestus)  was  in  charge  of  fire  and  the  skills  that  use  fire,
especially blacksmithing. When Charles Goodyear almost accidentally discovered how to vulcanize
rubber in 1839, he revolutionized the rubber industry. He called his process vulcanization because it
used  fire  to  heat  a  mix  of  rubber  and  sulfur.  Vulcanized  rubber  was  soon  being  used  for  shoes  and
other products, and in the Civil War balloons made of this new, stronger rubber carried Union spies
over the Confederate armies. The material's importance increased greatly over the years, and today
vulcanized rubber remains in use for automobile tires and numerous other products.
