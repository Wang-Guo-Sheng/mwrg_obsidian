- PEN/PUN comes from the Latin words poena, “penalty,” and punire, “to punish.” A penalty is, of
course, a punishment.

- [[penal]] 

 Having to do with punishment or penalties, or institutions where punishment is given.

• The classic novels Les Misérables and The Count of Monte Cristo portray the terrible conditions
in French penal institutions in the 19th century. 

A state or country's penal code defines its crimes and describes its punishments. During the 18th and
19th centuries, many countries established penal colonies, where criminals were sent as punishment.
Often  these  were  unbearably  severe;  but  it  was  to  such  colonies  that  some  of  Australia's  and  the
United  States'  early  white  inhabitants  came,  and  the  convicts  provided  labor  for  the  European
settlement of these lands.

- [[impunity]] 

 Freedom from punishment, harm, or loss. 

• Under the flag of truce, the soldiers crossed the field with impunity. 

Impunity is protection from punishment, just as immunity is protection from disease. Tom Sawyer, in
Mark Twain's novel, broke his Aunt Polly's rules with near impunity because he could usually sweet-
talk  her  into  forgiving  him;  if  that  failed,  he  had  enjoyed  himself  so  much  he  didn't  care  what
punishment she gave him.

- [[penance]] 
or wrongdoing. 

 An act of self-punishment or religious devotion to show sorrow or regret for sin

• In the Middle Ages bands of pilgrims would trudge to distant holy sites as penance for their sins. 

Penance as a form of apology for a mistake can be either voluntary or ordered by someone else. Many
religions include penance among the ways in which believers can show repentance  or  regret  for  a
misdeed. The Christian season of Lent, 40 days long, is traditionally a time for doing penance.

- [[punitive]] 

 Giving, involving, or aiming at punishment. 

•  The  least  popular  teachers  are  usually  the  ones  with  punitive  attitudes,  those  who  seem  to  enjoy
punishing more than teaching. 

Punitive is an important word in the law. When you sue a person or company for having wronged you
in  some  way,  you  normally  ask  for  something  of  value  equal  to  what  you  were  deprived  of  by  the
other  party.  But  when  the  defendant  has  done  something  particularly  bad,  you  may  also  ask  for
punitive  damages,  money  over  and  above  the  actual  cost  of  the  harm  done,  intended  to  teach  the
defendant a lesson. Punitive damages are fairly rare, but when they're actually granted they may be as
much as four times the size of the basic damages.
