- LOG, from the Greek word logos, meaning “word,” “speech,” or “reason,” is found particularly in
English  words  that  end  in  -logy  and  -logue.  The  ending  -logy  often  means  “the  study  of”;  so,  for
instance, biology is the study of life, and anthropology is the study of humans. And -logue  usually
indicates a type of discussion; thus, dialogue is conversation between two people or groups, and an
epilogue is an author's last words on a subject. But exceptions aren't hard to find.

- [[physiology]] 
  (1)  A  branch  of  biology  dealing  with  the  processes  and  activities  by
which living things, tissues, and cells function. (2) The life processes and activities of a living thing
or any of its parts. 

•  For  students  planning  to  go  to  medical  school,  the  university's  most  popular  major  is  Human
Physiology. 

The  Latin  root  physio-  generally  means  “physical,”  so  human  physiology  deals  with  just  about
everything  that  keeps  us  alive  and  working,  and  other  physiology  specialties  do  the  same  for  other
animals  and  for  plants.  To  do  anything  serious  in  the  field  of  health,  you've  obviously  got  to  know
how the body's organs and cells function normally. Physiology used to be considered separately from
anatomy, which focuses on the body's structures; however, it's now known that structure and function
can't easily be separated in a scientific way, so “anatomy and physiology” are often spoken of in the
same breath.

- [[methodology]] 

 A set of methods or rules followed in a science or field. 

•  Some  researchers  claimed  that  Dr.  Keller's  methodology  was  sloppy  and  had  led  to  unreliable
conclusions. 

The  methodology  employed  in  an  experiment  is  essential  to  its  success,  and  bad  methodology  has
spoiled thousands of research projects. So whenever a piece of research is published in a scientific
or  medical  journal,  the  researchers  always  carefully  describe  their  methodology;  otherwise,  other
scientists couldn't possibly judge the quality of what they've done.

- [[ideology]] 

 The set of ideas and beliefs of a group or political party. 

• By the time she turned 19, she realized she no longer believed in her family's political ideology. 

The  root  ideo-,  as  you  might  guess,  means  “idea.”  Ideas  and  theories  about  human  behavior  can
always be carried too far, since such behavior is very hard to pin down. So ideological thinkers—
people  who  come  up  with  large  theories  about  how  the  world  works  and  try  to  explain  everything
(and  maybe  even  predict  the  future)  according  to  those  theories—are  almost  always  disappointed,
sooner or later, to find that it doesn't really work out. A person intensely devoted to a set of political
ideas or theories can be called an ideologue—a translation of the French idéologue, a word actually
coined by Napoleon as a label for those political thinkers full of ideas he had no use for.

- [[cardiology]] 

 The study of the heart and its action and diseases. 

•  After  his  heart  attack,  he  actually  bought  himself  a  cardiology  textbook  and  set  about  learning
everything he could about his unreliable organ. 

The  root  card-  (closely  related  to  cord—see  CORD)  shows  up  in  many  heart-related  words.
Cardiologists frequently find themselves studying cardiograms, the charts of heart activity, made by
machines  called  cardiographs.  Heart  attacks,  and  deaths  caused  by  them,  have  both  declined  as  a
result of better medical emergency procedures, cholesterol-lowering drugs, and a decline in smoking.
But the factors likely to actually improve heart health, such as better diets and more cardiovascular
exercise  (exercise,  such  as  running,  that  improves  the  heart  and  blood  vessels),  haven't  made  any
progress  at  all.  So  we  should  all  be  prepared  to  perform  cardiopulmonary  resuscitation  (an
emergency procedure done on someone whose heart has stopped, to get the heart and lungs working
again).
