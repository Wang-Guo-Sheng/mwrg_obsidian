PUT comes from the Latin verb putare, meaning “to think, consider, or believe.” So, for example, a
reputation  is  what  others  think  of  you.  But  when  the  root  shows  up  in  such  words  as  compute,
dispute, and deputy, its meaning is harder to trace.

- [[reputed]] 

 Believed to be a certain way by popular opinion. 

• The 15th-century prince Vlad the Impaler is reputed to have inspired the character Dracula, though
in fact, evil though Vlad was, Dracula's creator only borrowed his nickname. 

Reputed  is  used  constantly  today  by  reporters,  and  almost  always  to  describe  suspected  criminals
—“the  reputed  mobster,”  “the  reputed  drug  kingpin,”  “the  reputed  gang  leader,”  etc.  But  the  word
shouldn't be left to journalists; your elderly aunt may, for instance, be reputed to have made a large
fortune  in  oil,  or  to  have  had  four  husbands  who  all  died  mysteriously.  Reputed  is  easy  to  confuse
with reputable, and they used to mean the same thing—that is, “having a good reputation”—but it's
become rare to hear reputed used with that meaning today.

- [[disrepute]] 

 Loss or lack of good reputation; disgrace. 

• The family had fallen into disrepute after the conviction and imprisonment of his father and uncle. 

A reputation can be easy to lose, and someone who is no longer respectable may eventually find he's
become  genuinely  disreputable—the  kind  of  person  that  almost  no  one  wants  to  be  seen  with.
Disrepute  isn't  only  for  individuals:  A  company  may  fall  into  disrepute  as  a  result  of  news  stories
about its products' defects; drug scandals have brought entire sports into disrepute; and a scientific
theory may fall into disrepute as a result of new discoveries.

- [[impute]] 

 To attribute. 

•  The  British  imputed  motives  of  piracy  to  American  ships  trying  to  prevent  them  from  interfering
with American trade during the War of 1812. 

Imputing  something  to  someone  (or  something)  usually  means  observing  something  invisible  in  that
person (or thing). We may impute meaning to a play or novel, or to a casual remark by a friend, that
was never intended. Many of us like to impute bad motives to others, while always regarding our own
motives as pure. In tax law, imputed income is something that isn't actual money but might as well be
—for example, the free use of a car lent to you by your employer.

- [[putative]] 

 Generally supposed; assumed to exist. 

• To strengthen the case for the defense, a putative expert took the stand. 

Putative is almost always used to express doubt or skepticism about a common belief. Thus, Tintagel
Castle  in  Cornwall,  a  picturesque  ruin,  is  the  putative  fortress  of  the  medieval  King  Arthur.  The
residents of New York City are putatively chic, neurotic, rude, and dangerous. And cable TV is full
of  putative  experts,  who  often  turn  out  not  to  have  much  knowledge  of  the  subjects  they're  talking
about.

- LOG, from the Greek word logos, meaning “word,” “speech,” or “reason,” is found particularly in
