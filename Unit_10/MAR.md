- MAR, from the Latin word mare,  meaning  “sea,”  brings  its  salty  tang  to  several  English  words.  A
submarine is an undersea ship. Marine means basically “relating to the sea,” so when the Continental
Marines were established back in 1775, their job was to provide on-board security on naval ships;
but they immediately began to be used on land as well, and the marines have continued to operate on
both land and sea ever since.

- [[marina]] 
facilities offering supplies or repairs. 

  A  dock  or  harbor  where  pleasure  boats  can  be  moored  securely,  often  with

•  The  coast  of  Florida  has  marinas  all  along  it  for  the  use  of  anything  from  flimsy  sailboats  to
enormous yachts. 

Marina comes straight from Latin, where it means simply “of the sea.” At a modern marina, sailors
can acquire whatever they need for their next excursion, or they can tie up their boats until the next
weekend  comes  along.  Some  even  imitate  John  D.  MacDonald's  famous  detective  hero  Travis
McGee, who lives on his boat in Miami and rarely leaves the marina.

- [[aquamarine]] 
greenish blue that is the color of clear seawater in sunlight. 

  (1)  A  transparent  blue  or  blue-green  gem.  (2)  A  pale  blue  or

• Many of the houses on the Italian Riviera are painted aquamarine to match the Mediterranean. 

Aqua  marina  is  Latin  for  “seawater,”  so  when  a  lovely  blue-green  form  of  the  semiprecious  gem
known as beryl was given an English name several centuries ago, aquamarine seemed appropriate.
Aquamarine is the ideal color that most of us carry around in our heads when we imagine the waters
that lap the shores of the Greek and Caribbean islands on a sunny day. But even the Mediterranean
and the Caribbean can take on lots of other colors depending on weather conditions.

- [[mariner]] 

 A seaman or sailor. 

• When he signed on as a mariner, the young Ishmael never suspected that the ship would be pursuing
a great white whale. 

In  Coleridge's  Rime  of  the  Ancient  Mariner,  an  old  seaman  tells  of  how,  by  shooting  a  friendly
albatross, he had brought storms and disaster to his ship, and how as punishment his shipmates hung
the great seabird around the mariner's neck and made him wear it until it rotted. The word mariner
has occasionally been used to mean simply “explorer,” as in the famous Mariner spaceflights in the
1960s and '70s, the first to fly close to Mars, Venus, and Mercury.

- [[maritime]] 
navigation or commerce on the sea. 

  (1)  Bordering  on  or  having  to  do  with  the  sea.  (2)  Having  to  do  with

• As a result of the ocean, Canada's Maritime Provinces—New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, and Prince
Edward Island—have a late spring but a mild winter. 

The maritime countries of Portugal and England produced many seafaring explorers during the 16th
and 17th centuries, many of whom sailed under the flags of other countries. Sailing for the Spanish,
Ferdinand  Magellan  captained  the  ship  that  was  the  first  to  circle  the  world,  charting  many  new
maritime  routes  as  it  went.  Henry  Hudson,  funded  by  the  Dutch,  sailed  up  what  we  call  today  the
Hudson River, claiming the maritime area that now includes New York City for the Netherlands.
