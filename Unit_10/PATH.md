- PATH comes from the Greek word pathos, which means “feeling” or “suffering.” So a pathetic sight
moves us to pity, and a sympathetic friend “feels with” you when you yourself are suffering.

- [[pathos]] 
sympathetic pity. 

 (1) An element in life or drama that produces sympathetic pity. (2) An emotion of

• The pathos of the blind child beggars she had seen in India could still keep her awake at night. 

Pathos comes directly from Greek. According to Aristotle, the persuasive power of public speaking
relies  on  three  elements:  the  speaker's  authority,  the  logic  of  the  speech,  and  the  speech's  pathos.
Aristotle claims that pathos is the appeal to the audience's sense of right and wrong, and that it is this
(unlike authority and logic) that moves the audience's emotions. Today we usually speak of pathos as
an  element  in  fiction,  film,  drama,  music,  or  even  painting,  or  the  real-life  pathos  of  a  situation  or
personality. Since pathos is closely related to pathetic, it's not surprising that, like pathetic, pathos
may occasionally be used a bit sarcastically.

- [[apathetic]] 

 (1) Showing or feeling little or no emotion. (2) Having no interest. 

• His apathetic response to the victory bewildered his friends. 

Apathy,  or  lack  of  emotion,  is  central  to  Albert  Camus's  famous  novel  The Stranger,  in  which  the
main  character's  indifference  toward  almost  everything,  including  his  mother's  death,  results  in  his
imprisonment. We feel little sympathy for him, and may even feel antipathy, or dislike. The American
voter is often called apathetic; of all the industrial democracies, only in America does half the adult
population fail to vote in major elections. As you can see, apathetic isn't the opposite of pathetic,
even though the a- [[that]] it begins with means “not” or “without.”

- [[empathy]] 

 The feeling of, or the ability to feel, the emotions and sensations of another. 

• Her maternal empathy was so strong that she often seemed to be living her son's life emotionally. 

In  the  19th  century,  Charles  Dickens  counted  on  producing  an  empathetic  response  in  his  readers
strong enough to make them buy the next newspaper installment of each novel. Today, when reading a
novel such as A Tale of Two Cities, only the most hard-hearted reader could fail to feel empathy for
Sidney Carton as he approaches the guillotine. One who empathizes suffers along with the one who
feels the sensations directly. Empathy is similar to sympathy, but empathy usually suggests stronger,
more instinctive feeling. So a person who feels sympathy, or pity, for victims of a war in Asia may
feel empathy for a close friend going through the much smaller disaster of a divorce.

- [[telepathic]] 
speech or signs. 

  Involving  apparent  communication  from  one  mind  to  another  without

• After ten years of marriage, their communication is virtually telepathic, and each always seems to
know what the other is thinking. 

Since  tele-  means  “distant”  (see  TELE),  you  can  see  how  telepathy  means  basically  “feeling
communicated from a distance.” The word was coined around 1880, when odd psychic phenomena
were being widely discussed by people hoping that researchers might find a scientific basis for what
they  believed  they  themselves  were  experiencing.  Today,  when  people  talk  about  extrasensory
perception,  or  ESP,  telepathy  is  usually  what  they're  talking  about.  In  recent  years,  the  notion  of
memes—ideas  that  might  somehow  physically  fly  from  brain  to  brain  so  that  people  all  over  the
world  might  have  the  same  idea  at  about  the  same  time  without  any  obvious  communication—has
been  widely  discussed.  Even  though  scientists  haven't  been  able  to  establish  the  existence  of
telepathy, about 30% of Americans continue to believe in it.
