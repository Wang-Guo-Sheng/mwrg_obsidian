- TERR  comes  from  the  Latin  terra,  “earth.”  A  territory  is  a  large  expanse  of  land.  Terra firma  is
Latin for “firm ground” as opposed to the swaying seas. A terrace is a leveled area, often one created
for farming on a sloping hill. And the French word for potato, pomme de terre, means literally “apple
of the earth.”

- [[parterre]] 
of the ground floor of a theater, often under the balcony. 

 (1) A decorative garden with paths between the beds of plants. (2) The back area

• The city's park boasts a beautiful parterre with many varieties of roses. 

Parterre comes to English by way of French, where it means “on the ground.” And in the early years
of the theater, the parterre was truly on the ground. In Shakespeare's day, an English theater's parterre
was the cheap standing-room area right in front of the stage, normally filled with rowdy spectators.
The original idea of the French parterre garden, with its carefully designed plots and walkways, was
to present an artistic pattern when seen from above—from a balcony, a raised terrace, or the top of an
outdoor staircase. English gardeners responded with garden designs that tried to make their viewers
half-forget that they were seeing something created by humans rather than untamed nature itself.

- [[subterranean]] 

 Underground. 

• In Carlsbad Caverns National Park there is an astonishing subterranean chamber over half a mile
long. 

A tunnel is a subterranean road or pathway, and a subway is a subterranean railway. The subterranean
vaults at Fort Knox hold billions of dollars of gold reserves. Subterranean reservoirs called aquifers
are tapped for water; in places where the pressure on the subterranean water is great enough, a hole
drilled in the ground will bring it bubbling to the surface.

- [[terrarium]] 
which plants and sometimes small animals are kept indoors. 

  An  enclosure,  usually  transparent,  with  a  layer  of  dirt  in  the  bottom  in

• When no one was watching, they dropped their snake in the fifth-grade terrarium, and then waited in
the hall to hear the screams. 

The turtle exhibit at a zoo is often in the form of a terrarium, as are some of the exhibits at a plant
conservatory.  In  an  ant  terrarium,  elementary-school  students  watch  the  ants  dig  their  network  of
tunnels  as  if  no  one  were  watching.  Terrariums  try  to  create  conditions  as  close  as  possible  to  a
natural habitat. A covered terrarium can often sustain itself for months on the moisture trapped inside.
But creating a good terrarium requires careful control not only of humidity but also of temperature, as
well as good ventilation; the lighting should include the full spectrum of sunlight as well as a day-
night regulator.

- [[terrestrial]] 
land instead of in water or air. 

 (1) Having to do with Earth or its inhabitants. (2) Living or growing on

• The roadrunner, although a largely terrestrial bird, can take flight for short periods when necessary. 

Everything on or having to do with Earth can be called terrestrial. Mercury, Venus, and Mars are often
called the terrestrial planets, since they are rocky balls somewhat like Earth rather than great globes
of gas like Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. Something extraterrestrial comes from beyond the
earth and its atmosphere; the word can be used to describe anything “out of this world,” from moon
rocks  to  meteors.  Turning  to  the  second  sense  of  terrestrial,  animals  are  often  divided  into  the
terrestrial  (land-living)  and  the  aquatic  (water-living).  And  sometimes  terrestrial  animals  are
contrasted with arboreal animals, those that live in trees.

- MAR, from the Latin word mare,  meaning  “sea,”  brings  its  salty  tang  to  several  English  words.  A
