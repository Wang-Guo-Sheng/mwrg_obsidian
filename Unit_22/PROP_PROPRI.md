- PROP/PROPRI  comes  from  the  Latin  word  proprius,  meaning  “own.”  A  proprietor  is  an  owner,
and property is what he or she owns. And the original meaning of proper was “belonging to oneself,”
so a writer around the year 1400 could say “With his own proper sword he was slain,” even if we
might not say it quite the same way today.

- [[proprietary]] 
the sole right to do so. (2) Privately owned and run as a profit-making organization. 

 (1) Relating to an owner or proprietor; made or sold by one who has

•  The  local  hospital  was  a  not-for-profit  institution,  whereas  the  nearby  nursing  homes  were
proprietary. 

A proprietary process is a manufacturing process that others are forbidden to use, and a proprietary
trademark is a name that only the owner can use. Legal rights of this kind are ensured by copyrights
and patents. After a certain period of time, inventions and processes lose their legal protection, cease
to be proprietary, and enter the “public domain,” meaning that everyone can use them freely. Baseball
fans often take a proprietary attitude toward their favorite team—that is, they behave more or less as
if they own it, even though the only thing they may own is the right to yell from a bleacher seat till the
end of a game.

- [[propriety]] 
what is socially acceptable, especially in conduct between the sexes. 

  (1)  The  state  of  being  proper;  appropriateness.  (2)  Acting  according  to

• Propriety used to forbid a young unmarried man and woman to go almost anywhere without an adult.

In  an  earlier  era,  when  social  manners  were  far  more  elaborate  than  they  are  today,  propriety  and
impropriety were words in constant use. Today we're more likely to use them in other contexts. We
may talk about the propriety of government officials' dealings with private citizens, the propriety of
the relationship between a lawyer and a judge, or the impropriety of speaking out of turn in a meeting
that  follows  Robert's  rules  of  order.  Relations  between  men  and  women  still  present  questions  of
propriety,  but  today  it's  often  in  the  workplace  rather  than  in  social  settings.  Wherever  rules,
principles,  and  standard  procedures  have  been  clearly  stated,  propriety  can  become  an  issue.
Something improper  usually  isn't  actually  illegal,  but  it  makes  people  uncomfortable  by  giving  the
impression that something isn't quite right.

- [[appropriate]] 
apart for a particular purpose or use. 

  (1)  To  take  exclusive  possession  of,  often  without  right.  (2)  To  set

•  It  was  one  of  those  insulting  words  that  sometimes  get  appropriated  by  a  group  that  it's  meant  to
insult, which then starts using it proudly and defiantly. 

From  its  roots,  the  verb  appropriate  would  mean  basically  “make  one's  own”—that  is,  “take,”  or
sometimes “grab.” Each year the President and Congress create a budget and appropriate funds for
each  item  in  it,  funds  which  mostly  come  in  the  form  of  taxes  from  the  public.  In  the  House  of
Representatives,  the  powerful  Appropriations  Committee  often  gets  the  last  word  on  how  much
money goes to each program. “Misappropriation of funds,” on the other hand, is a nice way of saying
“theft.” If someone appropriated pieces of your novel, you might take him or her to court; and if you
appropriated trade secrets from your former employers, you might be the one sued.

- [[expropriate]] 
transfer to oneself. 

  (1)  To  take  away  the  right  of  possession  or  ownership.  (2)  To

• It was only when the country's new government threatened to expropriate the American oil refineries
that Congress became alarmed. 

In ancient Rome, an emperor could condemn a wealthy senator, have him killed, and expropriate his
property. In 1536 Henry VIII declared himself head of the new Church of England and expropriated
the  lands  and  wealth  of  the  Roman  Catholic  monasteries.  And  nearly  all  of  North  America  was
expropriated  from  the  American  Indians,  usually  without  any  payment  at  all.  Today,  democratic
governments only carry out legal expropriations, in which the owners are properly paid for their land
—for example, when a highway or other public project needs to be built.
