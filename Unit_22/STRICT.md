- STRICT comes from the Latin verb meaning “to draw tight, bind, or tie.” So the English word strict
means “tightly controlled.” And when someone begins a sentence “Strictly speaking, . . .” you know
he or she is going to be talking about a word or idea in its most limited sense, “drawing tight” the
meaning till it's as narrow as possible.

- [[stricture]] 
criticism. 

 (1) A law or rule that limits or controls something; restriction. (2) A strong

• There are severe legal strictures on the selling of marijuana in almost every state. 

Stricture  has  meant  many  things  through  the  centuries,  and  its  “restriction”  meaning—probably  the
most  common  one  today—is  actually  the  most  recent.  High-school  teachers  often  put  strictures  on
texting  during  class.  Cities  concerned  about  their  murder  rate  have  slapped  strictures  on  the
possession of handguns. And the United Nations may vote to put strictures on arms sales to a country
that  keeps  violating  international  treaties.  With  the  meaning  “strong  criticism,”  stricture  is  slightly
old-fashioned today, but it's still used by intellectuals. So, for example, an article may amount to a
harsh  stricture  on  the  whole  medical  profession,  or  an  art  review  may  just  express  the  critic's
strictures on sentimental paintings of cute little houses with glowing windows.

- [[restrictive]] 
under limits as to use. 

 (1) Serving or likely to keep within bounds. (2) Serving or tending to place

• The deed to the property had a restrictive covenant forbidding any development of the land for 50
years. 

Restrictive  covenants  (that  is,  agreements)  in  real-estate  deeds  were  once  used  to  forbid  the  buyer
from ever selling the property to anyone of another race. These are now illegal, though other kinds of
restrictive covenants are very common; in some neighborhoods, they may even tell you what colors
you can't paint your house. In grammar, a restrictive clause is one that limits the meaning of something
that comes before it. In the sentence “That's the professor who I'm trying to avoid,” “who I'm trying to
avoid” is a restrictive clause, since it's what identifies the professor. But in the sentence “That's my
History professor, who I'm trying to avoid,” the same clause is nonrestrictive, since the professor has
already  been  identified  as  “my  History  professor.”  There  should  always  be  a  comma  before  a
nonrestrictive clause, but not before a restrictive clause.

- [[constrict]] 

 (1) To draw together or make narrow. (2) To limit. 

• She felt that small towns, where everyone seems to know every move you make and is just waiting
to gossip about it, can constrict your life terribly. 

Arteries  constricted  by  cholesterol  slow  the  flow  of  blood,  just  as  traffic  arteries  or  highways
constricted by accidents slow the flow of traffic. But constriction  isn't  always  physical.  Economic
growth may be constricted by trade barriers. A narrow, constricted life may be the result of poverty
or lack of opportunity. And an actress may feel constricted by a role she played as a child or by her
TV character from years ago, which the public refuses to forget.

- [[vasoconstrictor]] 
blood vessel. 

  Something  such  as  a  nerve  fiber  or  a  drug  that  narrows  a

• For operations like this, my dentist likes to use a vasoconstrictor to keep bleeding to a minimum. 

Our  blood  vessels  are  constantly  narrowing  and  widening  in  response  to  our  activity  or  our
environment, constricting in order to retain body heat and widening to get rid of excess heat. So when
we're hot our skin flushes, and when we're very cold we become pale. Since the width of the blood
vessels  affects  blood  pressure,  vasoconstrictors  are  prescribed  to  treat  low  blood  pressure.
Vasoconstrictors  include  antihistamines  and  amphetamines,  as  well  as  nicotine  and  caffeine;  we
commonly buy them for our runny noses and bloodshot eyes as well. The opposite of vasoconstrictors
are vasodilators, which are commonly used to treat high blood pressure.
