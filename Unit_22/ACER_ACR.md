ACER/ACR comes from the Latin adjective acer, meaning “sharp” or “sour.” Grapefruit and limes
have an acid  taste;  acid  can  also  describe  a  person's  sense  of  humor  (other  words  for  it  might  be
sharp or biting). The acidity of the soil often indicates whether it's good for growing certain crops;
blueberries,  for  instance,  love  acid  soil,  so  they're  more  likely  to  be  found  east  of  the  Mississippi
River, where acid soil is the rule.

- [[acerbic]] 

 Sharp or biting in temper, mood, or tone. 

• She had enjoyed his acerbic humor for years, but then a friend told her about the nasty jokes he was
making about her behind her back. 

Acerbic often describes wit. An acerbic critic won't make many friends among the writers or artists
whose work is being criticized, but often keeps his or her readers amused and entertained. Acerbity
may be slightly less sharp than sarcasm, but not much; both words have roots meaning basically “cut.”

- [[acrid]] 

 Unpleasantly sharp and harsh; bitter. 

• The acrid odor of gunpowder hung in the air long after the shots' echoes had died away. 

Acrid exactly fits the smoke from a fire—a burning building or forest, for example. Dense smog may
cast an acrid pall over a city, making throats burn and eyes sting. But, like acid and acerbic, acrid
sometimes also describes nonphysical things, such as the remarks of a bitter person.

- [[acrimony]] 

 Harsh or bitter sharpness in words, manner, or temper. 

• Town meetings here were usually civilized, and no one could recall an issue that had ever aroused
such intense acrimony as the new pulp mill. 

Acrimony  is  angry  harshness  that  usually  springs  from  intense  personal  dislike.  An  acrimonious
exchange  is  full  of  cutting,  unpleasant  remarks  designed  to  hurt.  Civil  wars  are  often  more
acrimonious and bloody than foreign wars. In the same way, a bad divorce may be more acrimonious
than any other kind of legal battle.

- [[exacerbate]] 

 To make worse, more violent, or more severe. 

• The increase in coal-burning power plants has greatly exacerbated the buildup of greenhouse gases. 

To  exacerbate  is  not  to  cause,  but  only  to  make  something  bad  even  worse.  So  the  loss  of  a  major
industry in a city may exacerbate its already serious unemployment problem. A vicious remark can
exacerbate a quarrel. Building a new mall may exacerbate an area's existing traffic problems. A new
drug can exacerbate the side effects of the drug a patient is already taking. It used to be thought that
too  much  blood  in  the  body  exacerbated  a  fever,  so  the  patient's  blood  would  be  drained,  often  by
means of leeches—and not all patients survived.

- STRICT comes from the Latin verb meaning “to draw tight, bind, or tie.” So the English word strict
