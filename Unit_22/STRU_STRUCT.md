- STRU/STRUCT  comes  from  the  Latin  verb  struere,  meaning  “to  put  together,  build,  arrange.”  A
structure is something that's been constructed,—that is, built or put together. Instructions tell how
the  pieces  should  be  arranged.  Something  that  obstructs  is  a  barrier  that's  been  “built”  to  stand  in
your way. And something destructive “unbuilds.”

- [[deconstruction]] 
 Analysis of texts, works of art, and cultural patterns that is
intended to expose the assumptions on which they are based, especially by exposing the limitations of
language. 

• Deconstruction has been performed on Huckleberry Finn by English professors so many times that
it's a wonder there's anything left of it. 

Deconstruction doesn't actually mean “demolition”; instead it means “breaking down” or analyzing
something (especially the words in a work of fiction or nonfiction) to discover its true significance,
which is supposedly almost never exactly what the author intended. A feminist may deconstruct an
old  novel  to  show  how  even  an  innocent-seeming  story  somehow  depends  on  the  oppression  of
women. A new western may deconstruct the myths of the old West and show lawmen as vicious and
criminals as flawed but decent. Table manners, The Sound of Music, and cosmetics ads have all been
the  subjects  of  deconstructionist  analysis.  Of  course,  not  everyone  agrees  with  deconstructionist
interpretations, and some people reject the whole idea of deconstruction, but most of us have run into
it by now even if we didn't realize it.

- [[infrastructure]] 
system of public works. 

  (1)  The  underlying  foundation  or  basic  framework.  (2)  A

• The public loved her speeches about crime but dozed off when she brought up highway repair and
infrastructure deterioration. 

Infra- [[means]] “below”; so the infrastructure is the “underlying structure” of a country and its economy,
the fixed installations that it needs in order to function. These include roads, bridges, dams, the water
and  sewer  systems,  railways  and  subways,  airports,  and  harbors.  These  are  generally  government-
built and publicly owned. Some people also speak about such things as the intellectual infrastructure
or the infrastructure of science research, but the meaning of such notions can be extremely vague.

- [[construe]] 
understand or explain; interpret. 

  (1)  To  explain  the  arrangement  and  meaning  of  words  in  a  sentence.  (2)  To

• She asked how I had construed his last e-mail, and I told her that something about it had left me very
worried. 

Construe  can  usually  be  translated  as  “interpret.”  It's  often  used  in  law;  thus,  an  Attorney  General
might  construe  the  term  “serious  injury”  in  a  child-abuse  law  to  include  bruises,  or  a  judge  might
construe  language  about  gifts  to  “heirs”  to  include  spouses.  The  IRS's  construal  of  some  of  your
activities might be different from your own—and much more expensive at tax time. Construing is also
close to translating; so when the British say “public school,” for instance, it should be construed or
translated as “prep school” in American terms.

- [[instrumental]] 
especially a musical instrument. 

 (1) Acting as a means, agent, or tool. (2) Relating to an instrument,

• His mother had been instrumental in starting the new arts program at the school, for which she was
honored at the spring ceremony. 

An instrument is a tool, something used to construct. It's often a tool for making music. A musical
saw  happens  to  be  a  carpenter's  tool  that  can  be  played  with  a  violin  bow  (though  you  probably
wouldn't want to play a wrench or a pair of pliers). The musical meanings of instrumental, as in “It
starts with an instrumental piece” or “a jazz instrumental,” are common. But the meanings “helpful,”
“useful,”  and  “essential,”  as  in  “He  was  instrumental  in  getting  my  book  published,”  are  just  as
common.

- PROP/PROPRI  comes  from  the  Latin  word  proprius,  meaning  “own.”  A  proprietor  is  an  owner,
