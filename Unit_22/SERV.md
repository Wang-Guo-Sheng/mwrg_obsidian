- SERV means “to be subject to.” A servant is the person who serves  you  with  meals  and  provides
other necessary services. A tennis or volleyball serve  puts  the  ball  in  play,  much  as  a  servant  puts
food on the table.

- [[serviceable]] 

 (1) Helpful or useful. (2) Usable. 

•  In  the  attic  they  found  some  chairs  and  a  table,  which,  with  a  new  coat  of  paint,  became  quite
serviceable for informal get-togethers. 

Someone  who  speaks  serviceable  Spanish  isn't  fluent  in  it  but  gets  by  pretty  well.  A  serviceable
jacket  is  practical  and  maybe  even  rugged.  But  serviceable  sometimes  damns  with  faint  praise.  A
serviceable  performance  is  all  right  but  not  inspired.  Serviceable  curtains  aren't  the  ideal  color  or
pattern,  but  they  serve  their  purpose.  A  serviceable  pair  of  shoes  is  sturdy  but  won't  win  you  any
fashion points.

- [[servile]] 

 (1) Suitable to a servant. (2) Humbly submissive. 

• The dog's manner was servile, and it lacked a healthy independence. 

During  the  Middle  Ages,  most  of  the  farming  was  done  by  a  servile  class  known  as  serfs,  who
enjoyed hardly any personal freedom. This began to change in the 14th century; but the Russian serfs
weren't  freed  until  the  1860s,  when  the  servile  class  in  the  U.S.  was  also  freed.  But  servile  today
usually refers to a personal manner; a person who shows servility usually isn't a servant, but simply
seems too eager to please and seems to lack self-respect.

- [[servitude]] 

 A state or condition of slavery or bondage to another. 

• She spent an entire summer working at a resort under conditions that felt like utter servitude. 

Servitude is slavery or anything resembling it. The entire black population of colonial America lived
in permanent servitude. And millions of the whites who populated this country arrived in “indentured
servitude,” obliged to pay off the cost of their journey with several years of labor. Servitude comes in
many forms, of course: in the bad old days of the British navy, it was said that the difference between
going to sea and going to jail was that you were less likely to drown in jail.

- [[subservient]] 
Slavishly obedient. 

  (1)  Serving  or  useful  in  an  inferior  situation  or  capacity.  (2)

• Many have wondered why Congress always seems subservient to the financial industry, supporting
it even when the voters are angrily calling for reforms. 

Since sub-  means  “below,”  it  emphasizes  the  lower  position  of  the  person  in  the  subservient  one.
Soldiers  of  a  given  rank  are  always  subservient  to  those  of  a  higher  rank;  this  subservience  is
symbolized by the requirement that they salute their superior at every opportunity. Women have often
been forced into subservient relationships with men. A small nation may feel subservient to its more
powerful neighbor, obliged to obey even when it doesn't want to. So subservience usually brings with
it a good dose of resentment.

- CLUS comes from the Latin claudere, “to close.” Words based on the Latin verb often have forms in
