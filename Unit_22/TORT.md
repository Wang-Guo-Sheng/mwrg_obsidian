- TORT  comes  from  a  form  of  the  Latin  verb  torquere,  meaning  “to  twist,  wind,  or  wrench.”  In
torture, parts of the body may be wrenched or twisted or stretched; so those “Indian sunburns” that
schoolkids  give  by  twisting  in  different  directions  on  some  unlucky  guy's  wrist  stay  pretty  close  to
torture's original meaning.

- [[tort]] 
receive damages in a civil action. 

 A wrongful act that does not involve breach of contract and for which the injured party can

• The manufacturer was almost bankrupted by the massive tort actions brought by employees harmed
by asbestos. 

Tort came into English straight from French many centuries ago, and it still looks a little odd. Its root
meaning  of  “twisted”  (as  opposed  to  “straight”)  obviously  came  to  mean  “wrong”  (as  opposed  to
“right”). Every first-year law student takes a course in the important subject of torts. Torts include all
the so-called “product-liability” cases, against manufacturers of cars, household products, children's
toys,  and  so  on.  They  also  cover  dog  bites,  slander  and  libel,  and  a  huge  variety  of  other  very
personal cases of injury, both mental and physical—Torts class is never dull. If you're sued for a tort
and  lose,  you  usually  have  to  pay  “damages”—that  is,  a  sum  of  money—to  the  person  who  you
wronged.

- [[extort]] 

 To obtain from a person by force, threats, or illegal power. 

• She had tried to extort money from a film star, claiming that he was the father of her baby. 

To extort is literally to wrench something out of someone. Extortion is a mainstay of organized crime.
Just as the school bully extorts lunch money from the smaller kids in exchange for not beating them up,
thugs  extort  “protection”  money  from  business  owners  with  threats  of  violence.  But  that's  only  one
kind of extortion; a mobster might extort favors from a politician with threats of revealing some dark
secret, just as you might extort a favor from a brother or sister by promising not to tell on them.

- [[contort]] 

 To twist in a violent manner. 

• The governor's explanation of his affair was so contorted that it only made matters worse for him. 

Circus contortionists are known for twisting their bodies into pretzels; such contortions tend to be
easier for females than for males, and much easier for the young than for the old. When trying to say
something uncomfortable or dishonest, people often go through verbal contortions. But when someone
else “twists” something you said or did, we usually say instead that they've distorted it.

- [[tortuous]] 
involved, complex. 

  (1)  Having  many  twists,  bends,  or  turns;  winding.  (2)  Crooked  or  tricky;

•  The  road  over  the  mountains  was  long  and  dangerously  tortuous,  and  as  you  rounded  the  sharp
corners you could never see whether a huge truck might be barreling down toward you. 

A labyrinth is a tortuous maze. The first labyrinth was built as a prison for the monstrous Minotaur,
half bull and half man; only by holding one end of a thread was the heroic Theseus able to enter and
slay the Minotaur and then exit. A tortuous problem, a tortuous history, and the tortuous path of a bill
through Congress all have many unexpected twists and turns; a tortuous explanation or argument may
be too crooked for its own good. Don't confuse tortuous with torturous, which means “tortured” or
“painfully unpleasant”; tortuous has nothing to do with torture.

- VIV comes from vivere, the Latin verb meaning “to live or be alive.” A survivor has lived through
