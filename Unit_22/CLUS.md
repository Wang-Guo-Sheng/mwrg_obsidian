- CLUS comes from the Latin claudere, “to close.” Words based on the Latin verb often have forms in
which the d becomes an s. So, for example, include, which once meant “to shut up or enclose” and
now means “to contain,” has the related word inclusive, which means “including everything.”

- [[occlusion]] 

 An obstruction or blockage; the act of obstructing or closing off. 

• The doctors worry that a loosened piece of plaque from the artery wall could lead to an occlusion
of a brain artery, resulting in a stroke. 

Occlusion, formed with the prefix ob-, here meaning “in the way,” occurs when something has been
closed up or blocked off. Almost all heart attacks are the result of the occlusion of a coronary (heart)
artery by a blood clot, and many strokes are caused by an occlusion in an artery serving the brain.
When  a  person's  upper  and  lower  teeth  form  a  malocclusion,  they  close  incorrectly  or  badly.  An
occlusion, or occluded front, happens when a fast-moving cold front overtakes a slow-moving warm
front and slides underneath it, lifting the warm air and blocking its movement.

- [[exclusive]] 
a high social class. (2) Full and complete. 

 (1) Not shared; available to only one person or group, especially those from

• That technology is exclusive to one cell-phone manufacturer, but some of the others are dying to use
it. 

In  words  such  as  expel,  export,  and  exclusive,  the  prefix  ex-  means  “out  of,  outside.”  Thus,  to
exclude means basically to close the door in order to keep someone or something out. When the word
appears in an advertisement, it's often making an appeal to snobs. An “exclusive” offer is supposedly
made to only a few people; not so many years ago, “exclusive” housing developments excluded those
of a certain race or color. If a product is being sold exclusively by one store, you won't be able to
find it anywhere else. When a newspaper or news show has an exclusive, it's a story that no one else
has  yet  reported.  Exclusive's  antonym  is  inclusive;  an  inclusive  policy,  an  inclusive  church,  or  an
inclusive approach is one that aims to include as many people as possible.

- [[recluse]] 

 A person who lives withdrawn from society. 

•  The  lonely  farmhouse  was  home  to  a  middle-aged  recluse,  a  stooped,  bearded  man  who  would
never answer the door when someone knocked. 

Greta  Garbo  and  Howard  Hughes  were  two  of  the  most  famously  reclusive  celebrities  of  modern
times. She had been a great international star, called the most beautiful woman in the world; he had
been  an  aircraft  manufacturer  and  film  producer,  with  one  of  the  greatest  fortunes  in  the  world.  It
seems that Garbo's reclusiveness resulted from her desire to leave her public with only the youthful
image of her face. Hughes was terrified of germs, though that was the least of his problems.

- [[seclusion]] 

 (1) A screening or hiding from view. (2) A place that is isolated or hidden. 

• The police immediately placed him in seclusion in a hospital room, with armed guards at the door. 

With its prefix se-, “apart,” seclusion  has  the  basic  meaning  of  a  place  or  condition  that's  “closed
away.” A lone island may be secluded, and its seclusion might be what its owner prizes most about it.
Presidents and their staffs may go into seclusion before making critical decisions. Monastery life is
purposely secluded, and monks may have taken vows to live lives of seclusion. The deadly brown
recluse spider prefers seclusion but is sometimes disturbed by very unlucky people.

- Greek and Latin Borrowings

acme 

 Highest point; summit, peak. 

• Last Saturday's upset victory over Michigan may prove to have been the acme of the entire season. 

In Greek, acme  meant  a  mountain  peak,  but  in  English  we  hardly  ever  use  it  in  the  physical  sense.
Instead we speak of someone's new job as the acme of her career, or of a certain leap as the acme of
classical dance technique. In old Road Runner cartoons, the Acme Company is the provider of every
ingenious  device  imaginable.  But  the  word  can't  always  be  taken  quite  literally  as  a  brand  or
company name; it's possible, for instance, that something called the Acme Bar & Grill may not be the
absolutely highest and best example of a bar and grill. And don't confuse acme with acne, the skin
disorder—even though both actually come from the same word.

- [[catharsis]] 

 A cleansing or purification of the body, emotions, or spirit. 

• Having broken down sobbing at the funeral, he said afterwards that it had felt like a catharsis. 

One  of  the  earliest  uses  of  catharsis  is  in  Aristotle's  Poetics,  where  the  philosopher  claims  that
watching  a  tragedy  provides  the  spectators  with  a  desirable  catharsis  because  of  the  buildup  and
release of the emotions of pity and fear. Sigmund Freud borrowed the term as a name for the process
of bringing a set of unconscious desires and ideas back into consciousness in order to eliminate their
bad  effects.  Today  some  people  claim  it's  cathartic  to  merely  express  your  anger  or  grief,  since  it
“gets  it  out  of  your  system.”  Laxatives  are  also  called  cathartic,  since  they  provide  a  physical
catharsis that some people believe to be healthful. But there's no general agreement about any of this,
and the notion of catharsis remains a very personal one.

- [[colossus]] 
or activity or influence. 

 (1) A gigantic statue. (2) A person or thing that resembles such a statue in size

• Even if Citizen Kane had been his only movie, Orson Welles would be regarded as a colossus in the
history of film. 

The original colossi (notice the plural form) were the larger-than-life statues made by the Greeks and
Romans. The most famous of these was the Colossus of Rhodes, a statue of the sun god Helios built
on  the  Greek  island  of  Rhodes  around  280  B.C.  that  was  over  100  feet  tall  and  took  more  than  12
years to build. The Statue of Liberty is a modern colossus, enormous and stately, at the entrance to
New  York  Harbor.  And  someone  who  has  played  a  colossal  role  in  history,  such  as  Winston
Churchill, may be called a colossus as well.

- [[detritus]] 

 Loose material that results from disintegration; debris. 

• The base of the cliff was littered with the detritus of centuries of erosion. 

After the first hard freeze of fall, gardens are sadly littered with the detritus of the summer's plants
and produce: stalks, leaves, vines, rotted vegetables, and maybe even a hand trowel left behind. As
the  flooding  Mississippi  River  retreats  back  to  its  ordinary  course,  it  leaves  detritus  behind  in  its
wake, debris gathered from everywhere by the raging waters. The detritus of civilization may include
junkyards and abandoned buildings; mental detritus may includes all kinds of useless trivia. Notice
how this word is pronounced; for some reason, people often try to accent the first syllable rather than
the second.

- [[hoi]] polloi 

 The general population; the masses. 

• He's a terrible snob, the kind of person who thinks it's funny to say things like “the riffraff” and “the
hoi polloi” and “the great unwashed.” 

In Greek, hoi polloi  means  simply  “the  many.”  (Even  though  hoi  itself  means  “the,”  in  English  we
almost always say “the hoi polloi.”) It comes originally from the famous Funeral Oration by Pericles,
where  it  was  actually  used  in  a  positive  way.  Today  it's  generally  used  by  people  who  think  of
themselves as superior—though it's also sometimes used in Pericles' democratic spirit. By the way, it
has no relation to hoity-toity, meaning “stuck-up,” which starts with the same sound but has nothing to
do with Greek.

- [[kudos]] 

 (1) Fame and renown that result from an achievement; prestige. (2) Praise. 

•  His  first  film  earned  him  kudos  at  the  independent  film  festivals,  and  the  big  studios  were  soon
calling him up. 

Kudos  is  an  odd  word  in  English.  In  Greek,  kydos  meant  “glory”  or  “prestige”;  in  other  words,  it
wasn't  something  you  could  count.  But  in  English  kudos  looks  like  a  plural  and  is  therefore  often
treated as one. So people now sometimes use the form kudo, with kudos as its plural.

- [[onus]] 

 A disagreeable necessity or obligation; responsibility. 

• Now that Congress has passed the bill, the onus is on the President to live up to his promise and
sign it into law. 

In Latin onus means literally a “burden,” like a particularly heavy backpack. But in English an onus is
more often a burden of responsibility or blame. In legal language, the onus probandi is the “burden of
proof,”  meaning  the  big  job  of  assembling  enough  evidence  to  prove  a  person's  guilt,  since  the
accused is innocent until proved guilty.

- [[stigma]] 

 A mark of shame: stain. 

• In these small villages, the stigma of pregnancy is a terrible thing for an unmarried girl. 

In Greek and Latin, a stigma was a mark or brand, especially one that marked a slave, so a stigma
marked  a  person  as  inferior.  When  the  plural  form  stigmata  is  used,  it  usually  refers  to  the  nail
wounds on Christ's hands and feet, wounds which have sometimes reappeared on the hands or feet of
later worshippers such as St. Francis. When stigma began to be used in English, it usually meant the
kind of mark or stain you can't actually see. So today we hear about the stigma of homelessness, the
stigma of overweight, and the stigma of mental illness. People may be so afraid of being stigmatized
for losing a job that they'll put on their office clothes and drive out their driveways every weekday
morning so that the neighbors won't know.
