- VIV comes from vivere, the Latin verb meaning “to live or be alive.” A survivor has lived through
something terrible. A revival brings something back to life, whether it's an old film, interest in a long-
dead novelist, or religious enthusiasm in a group, maybe in a huge tent in the countryside.

- [[vivacious]] 

 Lively in an attractive way. 

•  For  the  cheerleading  squad,  only  the  most  outgoing,  energetic,  and  vivacious  of  the  students  get
chosen. 

Vivacious  can  be  used  to  describe  a  piece  of  music  or  writing,  but  it's  generally  used  today  to
describe  people,  and  particularly  women.  The  main  female  characters  in  Shakespeare's  plays—
Beatrice in Much  Ado  About  Nothing,  Rosalind  in  As  You  Like  It,  and  Portia  in  The  Merchant  of
Venice, for example—are often full of humor, spirit, and vivacity.

- [[bon]] vivant 

 A sociable person with a love of excellent food and drink. 

• My uncle and aunt were bons vivants, and could usually be found in the evening at a swank midtown
bar surrounded by a crowd of tipsy merrymakers. 

Bon vivant comes straight from French, where it means literally “good liver,” and is still pronounced
in the French way, though we've actually been using it in English since the 17th century. A proper bon
vivant has some money and lots of friends and plenty of style and knows a good wine and can tell a
great story and loves to laugh. Because of all these requirements, true bons vivants are rather rare—
but that doesn't mean there aren't plenty of people who hope to be one someday.

- [[revivify]] 

 To give new life to; bring back to life. 

• All their efforts to revivify the boys' club seemed to be getting them nowhere, till one of the board
members had a great idea. 

Worn-out  soil  may  be  revivified  by  careful  organic  tending.  A  terrific  new  recruit  can  revivify  a
discouraged football team, and an imaginative and energetic new principal can revivify a failing high
school.  After  World  War  II,  one  European  country  after  another  was  slowly  revivified,  their
economies and cultural life gradually coming back to life. Notice that revivify looks like some other
words with very similar meanings, such as revive, revitalize, and reinvigorate.

- [[vivisection]] 

 Operation on living animals, often for experimental purposes. 

• The lab attempts to avoid vivisection in its research, concentrating instead on alternative methods
that have been developed. 

Vivisection includes the Latin root sect, meaning “cut.” The Greek physician Galen, who lived during
the 2nd century A.D., practiced vivisection on live monkeys and dogs to learn such things as the role
of the spinal cord in muscle activity and whether veins and arteries carry air or blood; his findings
formed the basis of medical practice for more than a thousand years. Vivisection continues to be used
in  drug  and  medical  research  today,  but  often  in  secret,  since  it  makes  most  people  very
uncomfortable and some groups are violently opposed to it.
