- DUC/DUCT,  from  the  Latin  verb  ducere,  “to  lead,”  shows  up  regularly  in  English.  Duke  means
basically  “leader.”  The  Italian  dictator  Mussolini  was  known  simply  as  Il Duce,  “the  leader.”  But
such  words  as  produce  and  reduce  also  contain  the  root,  even  though  their  meanings  show  it  less
clearly.

- [[conducive]] 

 Tending to promote, encourage, or assist; helpful. 

• She found the atmosphere in the quiet café conducive to study and even to creative thinking. 

Something conducive “leads to” a desirable result. A cozy living room may be conducive to relaxed
conversation,  just  as  a  boardroom  may  be  conducive  to  more  intense  discussions.  Particular  tax
policies  are  often  conducive  to  savings  and  investment,  whereas  others  are  conducive  to  consumer
spending. Notice that conducive is almost always followed by to.

- [[deduction]] 

 (1) Subtraction. (2) The reaching of a conclusion by reasoning. 

•  Foretelling  the  future  by  deduction  based  on  a  political  or  economic  theory  has  proved  to  be
extremely difficult. 

To deduct is simply to subtract. A tax deduction is a subtraction from your taxable income allowed by
the  government  for  certain  expenses,  which  will  result  in  your  paying  lower  taxes.  Your  insurance
deductible is the amount of a medical bill that the insurance company makes you subtract before it
starts to pay—in other words, the amount that will come out of your own pocket. But deduction also
means  “reasoning,”  and  particularly  reasoning  based  on  general  principles  to  produce  specific
findings.  Mathematical  reasoning  is  almost  always  deduction,  for  instance,  since  it  is  based  on
general  rules.  But  when  Dr.  Watson  exclaims  “Brilliant  deduction,  my  dear  Holmes!”  he  simply
means “brilliant reasoning,” since Sherlock Holmes's solutions are based on specific details he has
noticed rather than on general principles.

- [[induce]] 

 (1) Persuade, influence. (2) Bring about. 

• To induce him to make the call we had to promise we wouldn't do it again. 

Inducing  is  usually  gentle  persuasion;  you  may,  for  instance,  induce  a  friend  to  go  to  a  concert,  or
induce a child to stop crying. An inducement is something that might lure you to do something, though
inducements are occasionally a bit menacing, like the Godfather's offer that you can't refuse. Induce
also  sometimes  means  “produce”;  thus,  doctors  must  at  times  induce  labor  in  a  pregnant  woman.
Notice that induct and induction  are  somewhat  different  from  induce  and  inducement,  though  they
come from the identical roots.

- [[seduction]] 
Attraction or charm. 

  (1)  Temptation  to  sin,  especially  temptation  to  sexual  intercourse.  (2)

• The company began its campaign of seduction of the smaller firm by inviting its top management to a
series of weekends at expensive resorts. 

Seduction, with its prefix se-, “aside,” means basically “lead aside or astray.” In Hawthorne's novel
The  Scarlet  Letter,  Hester  Prynne  is  forced  to  wear  a  large  scarlet  A,  for  “adulteress,”  after  it  is
revealed  that  she's  been  seduced  by  the  Reverend  Dimmesdale.  Seduction  also  takes  less  physical
forms.  Advertisements  constantly  try  to  seduce  us  (often  using  sex  as  a  temptation)  into  buying
products we hadn't even known existed.

- SEQU comes from the Latin verb sequi, meaning “to follow.” A sequel follows the original novel,
