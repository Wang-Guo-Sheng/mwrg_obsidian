- CEPT comes from the Latin verb meaning “take, seize.” Capture, which is what a captor has done to
a captive,  has  the  same  meaning.  Captivate  once  meant  literally  “capture,”  but  now  means  only  to
capture mentally through charm or appeal. But in some other English words this root produces, such
as those below, its meaning is harder to find.

- [[reception]] 
welcomed. 

 (1) The act of receiving. (2) A social gathering where guests are formally

• Although the reception of her plan by the board of directors was enthusiastic, it was months before
anything was done about it. 

Reception is the noun form of receive. So at a formal reception, guests are received or welcomed or
“taken  in.”  A  bad  TV  reception  means  the  signal  isn't  being  received  well.  When  a  new  novel
receives good reviews, we say it has met with a good critical reception. If it gets a poor reception, on
the other hand, that's the same as saying that it wasn't well-received.

- [[intercept]] 

 To stop, seize, or interrupt (something or someone) before arrival. 

• The explosives had been intercepted by police just before being loaded onto the jet. 

Since the prefix inter means “between” (see INTER), it's not hard to see how intercept was created.
Arms shipments coming to a country are sometimes intercepted, but such interceptions can sometimes
be understood as acts of war. In football, soccer, and basketball, players try to intercept the ball as
it's  being  passed  by  the  other  team.  In  years  gone  by,  letters  and  documents  being  carried  between
officers  or  officials  were  sometimes  intercepted  when  the  carrier  was  caught;  today,  when  these
communications are generally electronic, an intercepted e-mail isn't actually stopped, but simply read
secretly by a third party.

- [[perceptible]] 

 Noticeable or able to be felt by the senses. 

•  Her  change  in  attitude  toward  him  was  barely  perceptible,  and  he  couldn't  be  sure  he  wasn't  just
imagining it. 

Perceptible includes the prefix per-, meaning “through,” so the word refers to whatever can be taken
in through the senses. A perceptive person picks up minor changes, small clues, or hints and shades of
meaning that others can't perceive, so one person's perception—a tiny sound, a slight change in the
weather, a different tone of voice—often won't be perceptible to another.

- [[susceptible]] 
action or process. 

 (1) Open to some influence; responsive. (2) Able to be submitted to an

• She impressed everyone immediately with her intelligence, so they're now highly susceptible to her
influence and usually go along with anything she proposes. 

With its prefix sus-, “up,” susceptible refers to something or someone that “takes up” or absorbs like
a sponge. A sickly child may be susceptible to colds, and an unlucky adult may be susceptible to back
problems.  A  lonely  elderly  person  may  be  susceptible  to  what  a  con  man  tells  him  or  her  on  the
phone.  And  students  are  usually  susceptible  to  the  teaching  of  an  imaginative  professor—that  is,
likely to enjoy and learn from it.

- FIN comes from the Latin word for “end” or “boundary.” Final describes last things, and a finale or
