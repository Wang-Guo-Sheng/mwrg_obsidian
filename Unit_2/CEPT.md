CEPT comes from the Latin verb meaning “**take, seize**.” [[capture|Capture]], which is what a [[captor]] has done to a [[captive]],  has  the  same  meaning.  [[captivate|Captivate]]  once  meant  literally  “capture,”  but  now  means  only  to capture mentally through charm or appeal. But in some other English words this root produces, such as those below, its meaning is harder to find.

- [[reception]] 
- [[intercept]] 
- [[perceptible]] 
- [[susceptible]]
