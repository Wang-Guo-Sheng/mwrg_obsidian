- JECT comes from jacere, the Latin verb meaning “throw” or “hurl.” To reject something is to throw
(or push) it back; to eject something is to throw (or drive) it out; and to inject something is to throw
(or squirt) it into something else.

- [[interject]] 

 To interrupt a conversation with a comment or remark. 

• His anger was growing as he listened to the conversation, and every so often he would interject a
crude comment. 

According  to  its  Latin  roots,  interject  ought  to  mean  literally  “throw  between.”  For  most  of  the
word's  history,  however,  the  only  things  that  have  been  interjected  have  been  comments  dropped
suddenly into a conversation. Interjections are often humorous, and sometimes even insulting, and the
best interjections are so quick that the conversation isn't even interrupted.

- [[conjecture]] 

 To guess. 

• He was last heard of in Bogotá, and they conjectured that he had met his end in the Andes at the
hands of the guerrillas. 

Formed with the prefix con-, “together,” conjecture means literally “to throw together”—that is, to
produce a theory by putting together a number of facts. So, for example, Columbus conjectured from
his calculations that he would reach Asia if he sailed westward, and his later conjecture that there
was a “Northwest Passage” by sea from the Atlantic to the Pacific over the North American continent
was proved correct centuries later.

- [[projection]] 
happening now. 

  An  estimate  of  what  might  happen  in  the  future  based  on  what  is

•  The  president  has  been  hearing  different  deficit  projections  all  week  from  the  members  of  his
economic team. 

Projection has various meanings, but what they all have in common is that something is sent out or
forward.  A  movie  is  projected  onto  a  screen;  a  skilled  actress  projects  her  voice  out  into  a  large
theater without seeming to shout; and something sticking out from a wall can be called a projection.
But the meaning we focus on here is the one used by businesses and governments. Most projections of
this kind are estimates of a company's sales or profits—or of the finances of a town, state, or country
—sometime in the future.

- [[trajectory]] 
follows as it rises and falls to earth. 

  The  curved  path  that  an  object  makes  in  space,  or  that  a  thrown  object

• Considering the likely range, trajectory, and accuracy of a bullet fired from a cheap handgun at 100
yards, the murder seemed incredible. 

Formed with part of the prefix trans-, “across,” trajectory means a “hurling across.” By calculating
the effect of gravity and other forces, the trajectory of an object launched into space at a known speed
can be computed precisely. Missiles stand a chance of hitting their target only if their trajectory has
been plotted accurately. The word is used most often in physics and engineering, but not always; we
can also say, for example, that the trajectory of a whole life may be set in a person's youth, or that a
new book traces the long trajectory of the French empire.

- TRACT comes from trahere, the Latin verb meaning “drag or draw.” Something attractive draws us
