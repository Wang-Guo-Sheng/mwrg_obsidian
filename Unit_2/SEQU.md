- SEQU comes from the Latin verb sequi, meaning “to follow.” A sequel follows the original novel,
film, or television show.

- [[sequential]] 

 (1) Arranged in order or in a series. (2) Following in a series. 

• In writing the history of the revolution, his challenge was to put all the events of those fateful days in
proper sequential order. 

Things  in  sequence,  or  regular  order,  are  arranged  sequentially.  Most  novels  and  films  move
sequentially, but some use techniques such as flashbacks that interrupt the movement forward in time.
Sequential courses in college must follow each other in the proper order, just like sequential tasks or
steps.

- [[subsequent]] 

 Following in time, order, or place; later. 

• Through all her subsequent love affairs, she never stopped thinking about the man who got away. 

The prefix sub- [[normally]] means “below,” and the sub- in subsequent seems to imply that everything
after  the  first  is  somehow  inferior.  As  the  definition  states,  subsequent  can  refer  to  time  (“All  our
subsequent  attempts  to  contact  her  failed”),  order  (“The  subsequent  houses  on  the  list  looked  even
worse”),  or  place  (“The  subsequent  villages  on  the  river  heading  east  become  steadily  more
primitive”). But subsequently, as in “I subsequently learned the real story,” simply means “later.”

- [[consequential]] 

 (1) Resulting. (2) Important. 

•  None  of  our  discussions  thus  far  has  been  very  consequential;  next  week's  meeting  will  be  the
important one. 

Something  consequential  follows  or  comes  along  with  something  else.  The  “resulting”  meaning  of
consequential  is  usually  seen  in  legal  writing.  For  example,  “consequential  losses”  are  losses  that
supposedly  resulted  from  some  improper  behavior,  about  which  the  lawyer's  client  is  suing.  But
normally consequential  means  “significant”  or  “important,”  and  it's  especially  used  for  events  that
will produce large consequences, or results.

- [[non]]  sequitur 
previously said. 

  A  statement  that  does  not  follow  logically  from  anything

• Rattled by the question, his mind went blank, and he blurted out a non sequitur that fetched a few
laughs from members of the audience. 

Non  sequitur  is  actually  a  complete  sentence  in  Latin,  meaning  “It  does  not  follow”—that  is,
something  said  or  written  doesn't  logically  follow  what  came  before  it.  It  was  Aristotle  who
identified the non sequitur as one of the basic fallacies of logic—that is, one of the ways in which a
person's reasoning may go wrong. For Aristotle, the non sequitur is usually a conclusion that doesn't
actually  result  from  the  reasoning  and  evidence  presented.  Sometime  when  you're  listening  to
politicians answering questions, see how many non sequiturs you can spot.

Answers

- Words from Mythology

Apollonian 

 Harmonious, ordered, rational, calm. 

• After a century of Romantic emotion, some composers adopted a more Apollonian style, producing
clearly patterned pieces that avoided extremes of all kinds. 

In Greek mythology, Apollo was the god of the sun, light, prophecy, and music, and the most revered
of all the gods. Partly because of the writings of Nietzsche, we now often think of Apollo (in contrast
to  the  god  Dionysus)  as  a  model  of  calm  reason,  and  we  may  call  anything  with  those  qualities
Apollonian. This isn't the whole story about Apollo, however; he had a terrible temper and could be
viciously cruel when he felt like it.

- [[bacchanalian]] 

 Frenzied, orgiastic. 

•  The  bacchanalian  partying  on  graduation  night  resulted  in  three  wrecked  cars,  two  lawsuits  by
unamused parents, and more new experiences than most of the participants could remember the next
day. 

The Roman god of drama, wine, and ecstasy, Bacchus was the focus of a widespread celebration, the
Bacchanalia.  The  festivities  were  originally  secret,  and  only  initiated  members  could  participate.
There was wine in abundance, and participants were expected to cut loose from normal restraints and
give in to all sorts of wild desires. Eventually the Bacchanalia became more public and uncontrolled,
finally  getting  so  out  of  hand  that  in  186  B.C.  the  Roman  authorities  had  it  banned.  Much  the  same
bacchanalian spirit fills tropical carnivals every year, including New Orleans' Mardi Gras.

- [[delphic]] 

 Unclear, ambiguous, or confusing. 

•  All  she  could  get  from  the  strange  old  woman  were  a  few  delphic  comments  that  left  her  more
confused than ever about the missing documents. 

Delphi  in  Greece  was  the  site  of  a  temple  to  Apollo  at  which  there  resided  an  oracle,  a  woman
through whom Apollo would speak, foretelling the future. The Greeks consulted the oracle frequently
on  matters  both  private  and  public.  The  prophecies  were  given  in  difficult  poetry  that  had  to  be
interpreted by priests, and even the interpretations could be hard to understand. When Croesus, king
of Lydia, asked what would happen if he attacked the Persians, the oracle announced that he would
destroy a great empire; what she didn't say was that the empire destroyed would be his own. Modern-
day  descendants  of  the  oracle  include  some  political  commentators,  who  utter  words  of  delphic
complexity every week.

- Dionysian 

 Frenzied, delirious. 

•  Only  in  the  tropics  did  such  festivals  become  truly  Dionysian,  he  said,  which  was  why  he  was
booking his flight to Rio. 

Dionysus was the Greek forerunner of Bacchus. He was the inventor of wine, which he gave to the
human  race.  For  that  gift  and  for  all  the  wild  behavior  that  it  led  to,  Dionysus  became  immensely
popular, and he appears in a great many myths. He is often shown holding a wine goblet, with his hair
full  of  vine  leaves,  and  attended  by  a  band  of  goat-footed  satyrs  and  wild  female  spirits  called
maenads.  In  the  19th  century,  scholars  such  as  Nietzsche  claimed  that  the  ancient  world  could  be
understood as a continuing conflict between the attitudes represented by Apollo (see Apollonian) and
Dionysus—that  is,  between  order  and  disorder,  between  moderation  and  excess,  between  the
controlled and the ecstatic.

- [[jovial]] 

 Jolly, good-natured. 

• Their grandfather was as jovial and sociable as their grandmother was quiet and withdrawn. 

Jove, or Jupiter, was the Roman counterpart of the Greek's Zeus, and like Zeus was regarded as chief
among the gods. When the Romans were naming the planets, they gave the name Jupiter to the one that,
as they may have already known, was the largest of all (though only the second-brightest to the naked
eye). When the practice of astrology reached the Roman empire from the East, astrologers declared
that those “born under Jupiter” were destined to be merry and generous, and many centuries later this
would result in the words jovial and joviality.

- [[mercurial]] 

 Having rapid and unpredictable changes of mood. 

•  His  mother's  always  mercurial  temper  became  even  more  unpredictable,  to  the  point  where  the
slightest thing would trigger a violent fit. 

The  god  Mercury,  with  his  winged  cap  and  sandals,  was  the  very  symbol  of  speed,  and  the  planet
Mercury was named for him by the Romans because it is the fastest-moving of the planets. His name
was  also  given  to  the  liquid  silver  metal  that  skitters  around  on  a  surface  so  quickly  and
unpredictably. And the word mercurial seems to have come from the metal, rather than directly from
the  god  (or  an  astrologer's  view  of  the  planet's  influence).  Mercurial  people  are  usually  bright  but
impulsive and changeable (and sometimes a bit unstable).

- Olympian 

 Lofty, superior, and detached. 

•  Now  77,  he  moved  slowly  and  spoke  to  the  younger  lawyers  in  Olympian  tones,  but  his  college
friends could remember when he was a brash, crazy risk-taker. 

The  Greek  gods  lived  high  atop  Mt.  Olympus,  which  allowed  them  to  watch  what  went  on  in  the
human  realm  below  and  intervene  as  they  saw  fit.  They  insisted  on  being  properly  worshipped  by
humans, but otherwise tended to treat the affairs of these weak and short-lived creatures almost like a
sport. So Olympian describes someone who seems “lofty” and “above it all,” as if surveying a scene
in which other people appear the size of ants. The Olympic Games were first celebrated in the 8th
century  B.C.,  at  the  religious  site  called  Olympia  (far  from  Mt.  Olympus),  and  Olympian  today
actually most often refers to Olympic athletes.

- [[venereal]] 

 Having to do with sexual intercourse or diseases transmitted by it. 

•  In  the  19th  century  syphilis  especially  was  often  fatal,  and  venereal  diseases  killed  some  of  the
greatest figures of the time. 

Venus was the Roman goddess of love, the equivalent of the Greek Aphrodite. Since she governed all
aspects of love and desire, a word derived from her name was given to the diseases acquired through
sexual contact. Most of these venereal diseases have been around for many centuries, but only in the
20th century did doctors devise tests to identify them or medicines to cure them. Today the official
term is sexually transmitted disease,  or  STD;  but  even  this  name  turns  out  to  be  ambiguous,  since
some of these diseases can be contracted in other ways as well.
