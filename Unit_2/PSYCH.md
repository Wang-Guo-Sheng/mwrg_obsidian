- PSYCH comes from the Greek word psyche, meaning “breath, life, soul.” Psychology is the science
of  mind  and  behavior,  and  a  psychologist  treats  or  studies  the  mental  problems  of  individuals  and
groups. Psychiatry  is  a  branch  of  medicine  that  deals  with  mental  and  emotional  disorders,  and  a
psychiatrist (like any other doctor) may prescribe drugs to treat them.

 Soul, personality, mind. 

• Analysts are constantly trying to understand the nation's psyche and why the U.S. often behaves so
differently from other countries. 

Sometime back in the 16th century, we borrowed the word psyche directly from Greek into English.
In Greek mythology, Psyche was a beautiful princess who fell in love with Eros (Cupid), god of love,
and went through terrible trials before being allowed to marry him. The story is often understood to
be about the soul redeeming itself through love. (To the Greeks, psyche also meant “butterfly,” which
suggests how they imagined the soul.) In English, psyche often sounds less spiritual than soul,  less
intellectual than mind, and more private than personality.

often extreme mental effects such as hallucinations. (2) Imitating the effects of psychedelic drugs.

• In her only psychedelic experience, back in 1970, she had watched with horror as the walls began
crawling with bizarrely colored creatures. 

The most famous—or notorious—of the psychedelic drugs is LSD, a compound that can be obtained
from  various  mushrooms  and  other  fungi  but  is  usually  created  in  the  lab.  The  other  well-known
psychedelics  are  psilocybin  (likewise  obtained  from  fungi)  and  mescaline  (obtained  from  peyote
cactus).  How  psychedelics  produce  their  effects  is  still  fairly  mysterious,  partly  because  research
ceased  for  almost  20  years  because  of  their  reputation,  but  scientists  are  determined  to  find  the
answers and much research is now under way. Psychedelics are now used to treat anxiety in patients
with  cancer,  and  are  being  tested  in  the  treatment  of  such  serious  conditions  as  severe  depression,
alcoholism, and drug addiction.

- [[psychosomatic]] 
illness. 

 Caused by mental or emotional problems rather than by physical

•  Her  doctor  assumed  her  stomach  problems  were  psychosomatic  but  gave  her  some  harmless
medication anyway. 

Since the Greek word soma means “body,” psychosomatic suggests the link between mind and body.
Since  one's  mental  state  may  have  an  important  effect  on  one's  physical  state,  research  on  new
medicines  always  involves  giving  some  patients  in  the  experiment  a  placebo  (fake  medicine),  and
some who receive the sugar pills will seem to improve. You may hear someone say of someone else's
symptoms,  “Oh,  it's  probably  just  psychosomatic,”  implying  that  the  physical  pain  or  illness  is
imaginary—maybe just an attempt to get sympathy—and that the person could will it away if he or she
wanted to. But this can be harsh and unfair, since, whatever the cause is, the pain is usually real.

•  He's  getting  medication  from  a  psychiatrist,  but  it's  his  sessions  with  the  psychotherapist  that  he
really values. 

Many  psychologists  offer  psychological  counseling,  and  psychological  counseling  can  usually  be
called psychotherapy, so many psychologists can be called psychotherapists. The most intense form
of psychotherapy, called psychoanalysis, usually requires several visits a week. A competing type of
therapy known as behavior therapy focuses on changing a person's behavior (often some individual
habit such as stuttering, tics, or phobias) without looking very deeply into his or her mental state.
