- TRACT comes from trahere, the Latin verb meaning “drag or draw.” Something attractive draws us
toward  it.  Something  distracting  pulls  your  attention  away.  And  when  you  extract  something  from
behind the sofa, you drag it out.

- [[traction]] 
slipping. 

  The  friction  that  allows  a  moving  thing  to  move  over  a  surface  without

• The spinning wheels were getting no traction on the ice, and we began to slip backward down the
hill. 

A  tractor  is  something  that  pulls  something  else.  We  usually  use  the  word  for  a  piece  of  farm
machinery,  but  it's  also  the  name  of  the  part  of  a  big  truck  that  includes  the  engine  and  the  cab.
Tractors  get  terrific  traction,  because  of  their  powerful  engines  and  the  deep  ridges  on  their  huge
wheels. A cross-country skier needs traction to kick herself forward, but doesn't want it to slow her
down when she's gliding, so the bottom of the skis may have a “fish-scale” surface that permits both
of these at the same time.

- [[retract]] 
said or written). 

  (1)  To  pull  back  (something)  into  something  larger.  (2)  To  take  back  (something

• She was forced to retract her comment about her opponent after it was condemned in the press. 

The prefix re- (“back”) gives retract the meaning of “draw back.” Just as a cat retracts its claws into
its paws when they aren't being used, a public figure may issue a retraction in order to say that he or
she no longer wants to say something that has just been said. But it's sometimes hard to know what a
retraction means: Was the original statement an error or an outright lie? Sometimes a politician even
has to retract something that everyone actually assumes is the truth. Thousands of citizens were forced
to  publicly  retract  their  “wrong”  ideas  by  the  Soviet  government  in  the  1930s  and  the  Chinese
government  in  the  1960s.  Someone  wrongly  accused  may  demand  a  retraction  from  his  accuser—
though today it seems more likely that he'll just go ahead and sue.

- [[protracted]] 

 Drawn out, continued, or extended. 

• No one was looking forward to a protracted struggle for custody of the baby. 

With its prefix pro-, “forward,” protracted usually applies to something drawn out forward in time. A
protracted strike may cripple a company; a protracted rainy spell may rot the roots of vegetables; and
a  protracted  lawsuit  occasionally  outlives  the  parties  involved.  Before  the  invention  of  the  polio
vaccines, polio's many victims had no choice but to suffer a protracted illness and its aftereffects.

- [[intractable]] 

 Not easily handled, led, taught, or controlled. 

• Corruption in the army was the country's intractable problem, and for many years all foreign aid had
ended up in the colonels' pockets. 

Intractable simply means “untreatable,” and even comes from the same root. The word may describe
both  people  and  conditions.  A  cancer  patient  may  suffer  intractable  pain  that  doctors  are  unable  to
treat. An intractable alcoholic goes back to the bottle immediately after “drying out.” Homelessness,
though it hardly existed thirty years ago, is now sometimes regarded as an intractable problem.
