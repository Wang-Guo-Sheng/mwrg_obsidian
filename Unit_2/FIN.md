- FIN comes from the Latin word for “end” or “boundary.” Final describes last things, and a finale or
a finish  is  an  ending.  (And  at  the  end  of  a  French  film,  you  may  just  see  the  word  “Fin.”)  But  its
meaning is harder to trace in some of the other English words derived from it.

- [[confine]] 
location. 

  (1)  To  keep  (someone  or  something)  within  limits.  (2)  To  hold  (someone)  in  a

•  He  had  heard  the  bad  news  from  the  CEO,  but  when  he  spoke  to  his  employees  he  confined  his
remarks to a few hints that sales had slipped. 

Confine  means  basically  to  keep  someone  or  something  within  borders.  Someone  confined  to  a
bedroom or a wheelchair is too ill or disabled to be anywhere else. A person under “house arrest” is
confined to his or her house by the government. At a business meeting, the discussion may be confined
to a single topic. A town may keep industrial development confined to one area by means of zoning.
And someone confined to the state prison for 20 years has probably committed quite a serious crime.

- [[definitive]] 

 (1) Authoritative and final. (2) Specifying perfectly or precisely. 

• The team's brilliant research provided a definitive description of the virus and its strange mutation
patterns. 

Something definitive is complete and final. A definitive example is the perfect example. A definitive
answer is usually a strong yes or no. A definitive biography contains everything we'll ever need to
know about someone. Ella Fitzgerald's famous 1950s recordings of American songs have even been
called definitive—but no one ever wanted them to be the last.

- [[finite]] 

 Having definite limits. 

• Her ambitions were infinite, but her wealth was finite. 

It  has  come  as  a  shock  to  many  of  us  to  realize  that  resources  such  as  oil—and  the  atmosphere's
ability  to  absorb  greenhouse  gases—are  finite  rather  than  unlimited.  The  debate  continues  as  to
whether  the  universe  is  finite  or  infinite  and,  if  it's  finite,  how  to  think  about  what  lies  beyond  it.
Religion  has  always  concerned  itself  with  the  question  of  the  finite  (that  is,  human  life  on  earth)
versus  the  infinite  (God,  eternity,  and  infinity).  But  finite  is  mostly  used  in  scientific  writing,  often
with the meaning “definitely measurable.”

- [[infinitesimal]] 

 Extremely or immeasurably small. 

• Looking more closely at the research data, he now saw an odd pattern of changes so infinitesimal
that they hadn't been noticed before. 

Just  as  infinite  describes  something  immeasurable  (“without  limit”),  infinitesimal  describes
something  endlessly  small.  When  Antonie  van  Leeuwenhoek  invented  the  microscope  in  the  17th
century,  he  was  able  to  see  organisms  that  had  been  thought  too  infinitesimally  small  to  exist.  But
today's electron microscope allows us to see infinitesimal aspects of matter that even Leeuwenhoek
could not have imagined.
