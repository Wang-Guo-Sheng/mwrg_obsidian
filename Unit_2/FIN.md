终点，边界

FIN comes from the Latin word for “**end**” or “**boundary**.” [[final|Final]] describes last things, and a [[finale]] or a [[finish]]  is  an  ending.  (And  at  the  end  of  a  French  film,  you  may  just  see  the  word  “Fin.”)  But  its meaning is harder to trace in some of the other English words derived from it.

- [[confine]]
