MANIA in Latin means “madness,” and the meaning passed over into English unchanged. Our word
mania  can  mean  a  mental  illness,  or  at  least  an  excessive  enthusiasm.  
We  might  call  someone  a [[maniac]] who was **wild**, **violent**, and mentally **ill**—or maybe just really **enthusiastic** about something.
Too much caffeine might make you a bit [[manic]]. But the intense mood swings once known as manic-depressive illness are now usually called **bipolar disorder** instead.
