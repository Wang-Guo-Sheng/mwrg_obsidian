MANIA in Latin means “madness,” and the meaning passed over into English unchanged. Our word
mania  can  mean  a  mental  illness,  or  at  least  an  excessive  enthusiasm.  We  might  call  someone  a
maniac who was wild, violent, and mentally ill—or maybe just really enthusiastic about something.
Too much caffeine might make you a bit manic. But the intense mood swings once known as manic-
depressive illness are now usually called bipolar disorder instead.

- [[kleptomania]] 
things. 

  A  mental  illness  in  which  a  person  has  a  strong  desire  to  steal

• Kleptomania leads its sufferers to steal items of little value that they don't need anyway. 

Klepto- [[comes]] from the Greek word kleptein, “to steal.” Even though kleptomania is often the butt of
jokes, it's actually a serious mental illness, often associated with mood disorders, anxiety disorders,
eating disorders, and substance abuse. Klepotomaniacs tend to be depressed, and many live lives of
secret shame because they're afraid to seek treatment.

- [[dipsomaniac]] 

 A person with an extreme and uncontrollable desire for alcohol. 

• She didn't like the word alcoholic being applied to her, and liked dipsomaniac even less. 

Dipsomaniac comes from the Greek noun dipsa, “thirst,” but thirst usually has nothing to do with it.
Some  experts  distinguish  between  an  alcoholic  and  a  dipsomaniac,  reserving  dipsomaniac  for
someone involved in frequent episodes of binge drinking and blackouts. In any case, there are plenty
of  less  respectful  words  for  a  person  of  similar  habits:  sot,  lush,  wino,  souse,  boozer,  guzzler,
tippler, tosspot, drunkard, boozehound--the list goes on and on and on.

- [[megalomaniac]] 
power and importance. 

  A  mental  disorder  marked  by  feelings  of  great  personal

• When the governor started calling for arming his National Guard with nuclear weapons, the voters
finally realized they had elected a megalomaniac. 

Since the Greek root megalo- [[means]] “large,” someone who is megalomaniacal has a mental disorder
marked by feelings of personal grandeur. Megalomania has probably afflicted many rulers throughout
history: The Roman emperor Caligula insisted that he be worshipped as a living god. Joseph Stalin
suffered from the paranoia that often accompanies megalomania, and had thousands of his countrymen
executed as a result. J.-B. Bokassa, dictator of a small and extremely poor African nation, proclaimed
himself  emperor  of  the  country  he  renamed  the  Central  African  Empire.  And  even  democratically
elected  leaders  have  often  acquired  huge  egos  as  a  result  of  public  acclaim.  But  megalomaniac  is
generally thrown around as an insult and rarely refers to real mental illness.

- [[egomaniac]] 
and concerns of others. 

 Someone who is extremely self-centered and ignores the problems

• He's a completely unimpressive person, but that doesn't keep him from being an egomaniac. 

Ego is Latin for “I,” and in English ego usually means “sense of self-worth.” Most people's egos stay
at a healthy level, but some become exaggerated. Egomaniacs may display a grandiose sense of self-
importance,  with  fantasies  about  their  own  brilliance  or  beauty,  intense  envy  of  others,  a  lack  of
sympathy, and a need to be adored or feared. But, like megalomaniac, the word egomaniac is thrown
around by lots of people who don't mean much more by it than blowhard or know-it-all.

- PSYCH comes from the Greek word psyche, meaning “breath, life, soul.” Psychology is the science
