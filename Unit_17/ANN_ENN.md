- ANN/ENN comes from Latin annus, meaning “year.” An annual event occurs yearly. An anniversary
is an example of an annual event, although the older you get the more frequent they seem to be.

- [[annuity]] 
for such payment. 

 Money that is payable yearly or on some regular basis, or a contract providing

•  Throughout  her  working  career  she  invested  regularly  in  annuities  that  would  support  her  after
retirement. 

Annuities are handy things to have when you retire, since they provide an income on an annual basis
or more frequently. Annuities are normally contracts with life-insurance companies that specify that
payments begin at retirement. Company pensions are traditionally doled out in the form of annuities,
and  sweepstakes  jackpots  may  also  come  as  annuities.  An  annuity  can  be  a  wise  idea  if  you  think
you're going to live a long time; however, annuities can be tricky and should only be purchased after
carefully comparing the products offered by various companies.

- [[superannuated]] 
retire because of old age or infirmity. 

 (1) Outworn, old-fashioned, or out-of-date. (2) Forced to

•  He  called  himself  a  car  collector,  but  his  backyard  looked  like  a  cemetery  for  superannuated
clunkers. 

A superannuated style is out-of-date—its time has come and gone. And a person who has passed an
age  limit  and  been  forced  to  retire  may  technically  be  called  superannuated.  But  more  often
superannuated describes people who seem somehow to belong to the past. So a 55-year-old surfer
might  be  regarded  as  superannuated  by  the  young  crowd  riding  the  waves  in  Santa  Cruz,  and  a
superannuated hippie might still be dressing the way he did in 1972.

- [[millennium]] 
year anniversary. (2) A period of great happiness and perfection on earth. 

 (1) A period of time lasting 1,000 years, or the celebration of a 1,000-

• The first millennium B.C. saw the rise of important civilizations in Greece, Rome, India, Central
America, and China. 

Since in Latin mille means “thousand” (see MILL), a millennium lasts 1,000 years. Thus, we're living
today  at  the  beginning  of  the  third  millennium  since  the  birth  of  Christ.  But  some  religious  sects,
relying on a prophecy in the biblical Book of Revelation, speak of a coming millennium when Jesus
will  return  to  reign  on  earth  for  1,000  years,  evil  will  be  banished,  and  all  will  live  in  peace  and
happiness.  Members  of  these  sects  who  keep  themselves  in  a  constant  state  of  preparedness  are
called millenarians or millennialists.

- [[perennial]] 
without interruption. 

  (1)  Continuing  to  grow  for  several  years.  (2)  Enduring  or  continuing

• “See You in September” is a perennial summertime hit among lovesick teenagers. 

A perennial garden is full of perennials like delphiniums and asters, flowers that continue to bloom
year after year. (Annuals, by contrast, grow for only a single season and must be replanted annually,
and  biennials  die  after  two  years.)  Evergreens  are  perennially  green;  for  that  reason,  they're
perennial  favorites  for  Christmas  wreaths  and  decorations.  In  a  similar  way,  taxes  are  a  perennial
political issue; and a perennial political candidate may come back over and over claiming he's the
only one who can save us from them.

- EV comes from the Latin aevum, “age” or “lifetime.” Though the root occurs in only a few English
