- CODI/CODE  comes  from  the  Latin  codex,  meaning  “trunk  of  a  tree”  or  “document  written  on
wooden tablets.” A code can be either a set of laws or a system of symbols used to write messages.
To  encode  a  message  is  to  write  it  in  code.  A  genetic  code,  transmitted  by  genes,  is  a  set  of
instructions for everything from blood type to eye color.

- [[codex]] 
texts. 

 A book in handwritten form, especially a book of Scripture, classics, or ancient

• There on the shelves of the monastery library they saw codex after codex, all carefully copied and
illustrated by hand. 

In the 3rd and 4th centuries A.D., the codex began to replace the older scroll as the preferred form for
longer writings. Unlike the scroll, this wonderful invention permitted writing on both sides of a sheet,
made it easy to locate a particular passage, and could contain a very long piece of writing. Codices
(note this unusual plural form) were usually written on parchment, the specially prepared skin of a
sheep or goat, or papyrus, the ancestor of paper. Because codices were handwritten, there were few
copies of any single codex, and sometimes only a single copy. Today we no longer write our books in
longhand, but the modern book has kept basically the same form as the original codices.

- [[codicil]] 

 (1) An amendment or addition made to a will. (2) An appendix or supplement. 

• With the birth of each new grandchild, the old man added a new codicil to his will. 

A codicil is literally a “little codex,” a little bit of writing on a small piece of writing material, used
to add to or change something about a larger piece of writing. A codicil to a will can change the terms
of the original will completely, so it generally requires witnesses just like the will itself, though in
some states a handwritten codicil may not. In mystery novels, such changes have been known to cause
murders; in real life, codicils aren't usually quite that exciting.

- [[codify]] 

 To arrange according to a system; classify. 

• In the 6th century B.C., the great statesman Solon newly codified the laws of Athens, replacing the
harsh legal code of Draco. 

A code  is  a  collection  of  laws  arranged  in  an  orderly  way;  famous  examples  include  the  Code  of
Hammurabi,  from  about  1760  B.C.  in  ancient  Babylon,  and  the  Napoleonic  Code,  produced  at
Napoleon's orders in 1804. Laws that have been included in a code have been codified. The rules of
baseball differed greatly from one place to another until they were codified by Alexander Cartwright
in 1845; they haven't changed much since, though we don't know what Cartwright would say about the
designated hitter.

- [[decode]] 
meaning of; decipher. 

 (1) To put a coded message into an understandable form. (2) To find the underlying

• The Allies were able to decode many important secret messages sent by the Germans and Japanese
in World War II. 

To decode is to take out of code and put into understandable language. (Its opposite is encode, “to put
into coded form.”) But dreams may sometimes also be decoded; psychologists often try to decode the
images of their patients' dreams so as to understand the emotions behind them. And readers must often
decode  what  a  novel  or  story  or  poem  is  telling  them,  which  may  require  two  or  three  readings.
Decipher is often a synonym, though we now use it when talking about reading difficult handwriting.

- SIGN comes from the Latin noun signum, “mark or sign.” A signal is a kind of sign. Your signature
