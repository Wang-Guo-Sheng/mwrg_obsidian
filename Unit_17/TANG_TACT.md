- TANG/TACT comes from the Latin words tangere, “to touch,” and tactus, “sense of touch.” So, for
instance, to make contact is to touch or “get in touch with.”

- [[tact]] 

 The ability to deal with others without offending them. 

• Already at 16 his daughter showed remarkable tact in dealing with adults, which she certainly hadn't
gotten from him. 

This  word  came  to  English  directly  from  French  (a  Latin-based  language),  where  it  can  also  mean
simply “sense of touch.” Dealing with difficult situations involving other people can require the kind
of  extreme  sensitivity  that  our  fingertips  possess.  As  Lincoln  once  said,  “Tact  is  the  ability  to
describe others as they see themselves,” which doesn't usually come naturally. Someone tactful can
soothe the feelings of the most difficult people; a tactless person will generally make a bad situation
worse.

- [[tactile]] 

 (1) Able to be perceived by touching. (2) Relating to the sense of touch. 

• He always enjoyed the tactile sensation of running his hand over the lush turf. 

If  you  set  your  cell  phone  to  vibrate  rather  than  ring,  you're  taking  the  tactile  option.  Educators
believe that some students are naturally “tactile learners,” much better at “hands-on” learning than at
tasks that involve patient listening and reading. Many longtime readers resist using e-books, saying
they miss the tactile sensations of leafing through an actual book. And the blind, using the raised dots
of the braille alphabet, rely entirely on their tactile sense to read; some can actually read as fast as the
average person can read out loud.

- [[tangential]] 

 Touching lightly; incidental. 

• The government is trying to determine if the extremists were deeply involved or if their relationship
to the suspect was merely tangential. 

In geometry, a tangent is a straight line that touches a curve at a single point. So we say that someone
who starts talking about one thing and gets sidetracked has gone off on a tangent. The new subject is
tangential to the first subject—it touches it and moves off in a different direction.

- [[tangible]] 

 Able to be perceived, especially by touch; physical, substantial. 

• The snow was tangible evidence that winter had really come. 

Something that's literally tangible can be touched. A rock is tangible, and so is a broken window; if
the rock is lying next to the window, it could be tangible evidence of vandalism. When we say that the
tension  in  a  room  is  tangible,  we  mean  we  feel  it  so  strongly  that  it  seems  almost  physical.  But  if
we're being literal, tension, like hope, happiness, and hunger, is literally intangible—it may be real,
but it can't be touched. When lawyers talk about an intangible asset, they might mean something like a
company's good reputation—very valuable, but not quite touchable.
