- FIG comes from a Latin verb meaning “to shape or mold” and a noun meaning “a form or shape.” So
a figure is usually a shape. A transfiguration transforms the shape or appearance of something. And a
disfiguring injury changes the appearance of part of the body for the worse.

- [[figurative]] 
normally meaning or describing another thing. 

  (1)  Representing  form  or  figure  in  art.  (2)  Saying  one  thing  in  terms

• When the poet says he's been living in the desert, it's a figurative reference to his emotional life. 

Words  and  phrases  can  have  both  literal  and  figurative  meanings,  and  we  all  use  words  with  both
kinds  of  meanings  every  day  of  our  lives.  We  can  literally  close  the  door  to  a  room,  or  we  can
figuratively  close  the  door  to  further  negotiations—that  is,  refuse  to  take  part  in  them.  Figurative
language includes figures of speech, such as similes (“she's been like a sister to me”) and metaphors
(“a storm of protest”). And sometimes it's hard to tell whether a phrase is literal or figurative: If I say
I “picked up” a little Spanish in Mexico, is that literal or figurative? You've probably noticed that lots
of the definitions in this book show both a literal meaning (often something physical) and a figurative
meaning (often nonphysical).

- [[configuration]] 

 An arrangement of parts or elements; shape, design. 

•  We've  changed  the  configuration  of  the  office  so  that  employees  will  have  more  privacy  at  their
desks. 

The term is very common in computer science and mathematics, and in scientific and technological
fields in general. Thus, for example, two scientists won a 1962 Nobel Prize for their description of
the  configuration  of  the  DNA  molecule.  Since  then,  researchers  have  studied  what  different
configurations within the DNA strands mean and what they control, and genetic engineers have tried
to configure or reconfigure DNA in new ways to prevent or treat diseases.

- [[effigy]] 

 An image of a person, especially a crude representation of a hated person. 

• The night before the big game, an effigy of the rival coach was burned on a huge bonfire. 

It was the practice of the ancient Egyptians to bury an effigy of a dead person along with that person's
body. The idea was that if anything happened to the body in the afterlife, the effigy could be used as a
spare.  Effigy  now  usually  refers  to  crude  stuffed  figures  of  the  kind  that  get  abused  by  angry
protestors and unruly college students. But the small dolls that witches have used to bring pain and
death on their victims can be called effigies as well. Actually, those witches and college kids seem to
use their effigies for pretty much the same thing.

- [[figment]] 

 Something made up or imagined. 

• His preference for Cindy is a figment of your imagination; believe me, he barely knows she exists. 

A  figment  is  something  formed  from  imaginary  elements.  Daydreams  are  figments;  nightmares  are
figments that can seem very real. Most figments are everyday fears and hopes about small things that
turn out to be imaginary. But when the radio play “The War of the Worlds” aired in 1938, it caused a
panic among thousands of people who didn't realize the Martian invasion was just a figment of the
author's imagination.
