ANIM  comes  from  the  Latin  anima,  meaning  “breath”  or  “soul.”  So,  for  example,  an  animal  is  a
living, breathing thing—though human animals have often argued about whether other species actually
have souls.

• Her gestures as she talked were so animated that even people across the room were watching her. 

Animated  cartoon  characters  have  been  “given  life”  by  film  techniques,  though  the  animation  of
drawings actually goes back to handheld toys in the 1830s. A child watching the cartoon may also be
animated—squealing,  laughing,  and  jumping  around—as  can  a  crowd  of  hockey  fans  or  a  rock-
concert audience. And the best discussions and arguments are often highly animated.

forgiving. 

  (1)  Showing  a  lofty  and  courageous  spirit.  (2)  Generous  and

• She was magnanimous in victory, saying she'd been lucky to win and praising her opponent's effort. 

The  basic  meaning  of  magnanimity  is  “greatness  of  spirit.”  Thus,  magnanimity  is  the  opposite  of
pettiness or “smallness.” A truly magnanimous person can lose without complaining and win without
gloating.  Angry  disputes  can  sometimes  be  resolved  when  one  side  makes  a  magnanimous  gesture
toward  the  other.  And  it's  the  mark  of  magnanimity  to  give  credit  to  everyone  who  worked  on  a
project even if you'd rather it all went to you.

- [[animosity]] 

 Ill will or resentment. 

• Legend has it that the animosity between the Greeks and the Trojans began with the stealing of the
beautiful Helen from her husband, Menelaus. 

The  important  Latin  word  animus  (very  closely  related  to  anima)  could  mean  a  great  many  things
having to do with the soul and the emotions, one of them being “anger.” As an English word, animus
has generally meant “ill will,” so it isn't mysterious that animosity means basically the same thing.
Animosity  can  exist  between  two  people,  two  groups  or  organizations,  or  two  countries,  and  can
sometimes lie hidden for years before reappearing. The deep animosities that exist between certain
ethnic and religious groups sometimes seem as if they will last forever.

- [[inanimate]] 

 (1) Not alive; lifeless. (2) Not lively; dull. 

•  The  sculptures  of  Rodin  are  so  expressive  that,  although  inanimate,  they  seem  full  of  life  and
emotion. 

The  couch  you  sit  on  while  you  watch  TV  is  an  inanimate  object,  as  is  your  footrest,  your  bag  of
snacks, and your remote control. Spend too much time on that couch and you risk becoming a couch
potato. (A potato is an inanimate object.)

- FIG comes from a Latin verb meaning “to shape or mold” and a noun meaning “a form or shape.” So
