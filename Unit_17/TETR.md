- TETR  comes  from  the  Greek  word  for  “four.”  In  the  immensely  popular  video  game  Tetris,  for
example, each of the pieces the game is played with has four segments. But the root usually shows up
in long chemical names.

- [[tetracycline]] 

 A yellow broad-spectrum antibiotic. 

• He was sent home with a prescription for tetracycline and some advice about how to avoid Lyme
disease in the future. 

Most  chemical  names  are  made  up  of  two  or  more  Greek  and  Latin  roots  strung  together.  Thus,
tetracycline,  with  its  cycl-  root  from  the  Greek  word  for  “circle,”  means  “four-ringed”—that  is,
“consisting  of  four  fused  hydrocarbon  rings.”  Antibiotics  work  against  bacteria  and  other  tiny
organisms (but not viruses); tetracycline, which comes from a kind of soil bacteria, is one of the most
used  of  the  antibiotics.  “Broad-spectrum”  antibiotics  work  well  on  numerous  organisms;  thus,
tetracycline has proved effective against acne, chlamydia, cholera, rickets, and various lung and eye
infections, among many other conditions.

- [[tetrahedron]] 

 A solid shape formed by four flat faces. 

•  Her  son's  box  kites  was  a  tetrahedron,  and  its  pyramid  shape  was  easy  to  pick  out  among  the
traditional designs flown by the other children. 

The simplest tetrahedron is made of four equal-sided triangles: one is used as the base, and the other
three  are  fitted  to  it  and  each  other  to  make  a  pyramid.  But  the  great  pyramids  of  Egypt  aren't
tetrahedrons: they instead have a square base and four triangular faces, and thus are five-sided rather
than four-sided.

- [[tetralogy]] 

 A set of four connected literary, artistic, or musical works. 

• The Raj Quartet, Paul Scott's long and complex tetralogy of India, was made into a highly praised
television series. 

Vivaldi's Four Seasons could be called a tetralogy, since it's a set of four violin concertos, one for
each season of the year. Eight of Shakespeare's history plays are often grouped into two tetralogies.
Wagner's great Ring of the Nibelung, an opera tetralogy based on Norse mythology, contains about 18
hours  of  music.  The  original  tetralogies,  however,  were  sets  of  four  plays  by  the  same  author
performed together in ancient Greece; the first three were always tragedies, and the last was a wild
comedy. Tetralogies were written by such great dramatists as Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripedes;
unfortunately, none of them have survived in their entirety.

- [[tetrapod]] 

 A vertebrate with two pairs of limbs. 

• His special study was the great seismosaurus, probably the largest tetrapod—and the largest land
animal—that ever lived. 

The earliest tetrapods, or “four-footed” animals, were mammal-like reptiles that evolved before the
rise  of  the  dinosaurs  and  ranged  from  mouse-sized  to  cow-sized.  Today  the  tetrapods  include  the
reptiles,  the  amphibians,  the  birds,  and  the  mammals—including  humans.  Though  the  fish  aren't
classified  as  tetrapods,  it's  quite  possible  that  our  own  limbs  began  as  paired  fins  hundreds  of
millions of years ago.
