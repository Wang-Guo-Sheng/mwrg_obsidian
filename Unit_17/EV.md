- EV comes from the Latin aevum, “age” or “lifetime.” Though the root occurs in only a few English
words, it's related to the Greek aion, “age,” from which we get the word eon, meaning “a very long
period of time.”

- [[coeval]] 

 Having the same age or lasting the same amount of time; contemporary. 

•  Homer's  Iliad  and  Odyssey,  probably  written  around  700  B.C.,  are  coeval  with  portions  of  the
Hebrew Bible, or Old Testament. 

Coeval  usually  describes  things  that  existed  together  for  a  very  long  time  or  that  originated  at  the
same  time  in  the  distant  past.  Thus,  astronomers  might  speak  of  one  galaxy  as  being  coeval  with
another,  and  a  period  in  the  history  of  one  civilization  might  be  coeval  with  a  similar  period  in
another. As a noun, however, coeval may describe people as well; so, for example, two artists who
lived and worked at the same time might be described as coevals.

- [[longevity]] 

 (1) A long duration of life. (2) Length of life; long continuance. 

• Picasso had a career of remarkable longevity, and was producing plentifully until his death at 91. 

As  living  conditions  improve  and  the  science  of  medicine  advances,  the  longevity  of  the  average
American  has  increased  greatly,  from  about  45  years  in  1900  to  over  75  years  today.  But  the  most
impressive human longevity is nothing compared to the 400-year lifespan of an ocean clam found near
Iceland, or the 5,000-year lifespan of the bristlecone pine, a tree found in the western U.S. We may
use longevity to talk not only about actual lives but also of the useful “life” of things: the life of your
car's tires or the shingles on your roof, for example.

- [[medieval]] 
to 1500. (2) Extremely out-of-date. 

 (1) Relating to the Middle Ages of European history, from about A.D. 500

•  The  great  cathedral  at  Chartres  in  France,  finished  in  1220,  is  a  masterpiece  of  medieval
architecture. 

With  its  roots  medi-,  meaning  “middle,”  and  ev-,  meaning  “age,”  medieval  literally  means  “of  the
Middle Ages.” In this case, middle means “between the Roman empire and the Renaissance”—that is,
after the fall of the great Roman state and before the “rebirth” of culture that we call the Renaissance.
This  same  period  used  to  be  called  the  “Dark  Ages,”  since  it  was  believed  that  in  these  years
civilization  all  but  vanished.  And  indeed,  for  most  Europeans  in  these  centuries,  it  was  a  time  of
poverty, famine, plague, and superstition, rather than the age of magic, dazzling swordplay, towering
castles, and knights in splendid armor displayed in today's graphic novels and video games.

- [[primeval]] 
from the beginning. 

  (1)  Having  to  do  with  the  earliest  ages;  primitive  or  ancient.  (2)  Existing

•  When  European  settlers  first  arrived  in  North  America,  they  found  vast  tracts  of  primeval  forest,
seemingly untouched by human influence. 

With its prim- [[prefix]], meaning “first,” primeval obviously refers to an original age. So the word often
suggests the earliest periods in the earth's history. Myths are often stories of the creation of the world
and  of  its  primeval  beings.  The  trees  in  a  primeval  forest  (few  of  which  remain  today  in  most
countries)  may  be  400  years  old—not  as  old  as  the  world,  but  maybe  as  old  as  they  ever  live  to.
According  to  scientists,  life  on  earth  began  in  the  protein-rich  waters  of  the  primeval  seas  and
swamps, and the decay of their tiny organisms and plant matter over millions of years produced our
petroleum and coal.
