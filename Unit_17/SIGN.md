- SIGN comes from the Latin noun signum, “mark or sign.” A signal is a kind of sign. Your signature
is your own personal sign. And an architect's design marks out the pattern for a building.

- [[signify]] 
especially by a sign. 

 (1) To be a sign of something; to mean something. (2) To show or make known,

• The improved performance of the students signifies that the new approach may be working. 

Signify basically means “to make a sign or signal.” One of its synonyms is indicate; the index finger
is  the  finger  you  point  with,  so  to  indicate  is  essentially  to  point  to  something.  Significant  means
“important” and significance means “importance”; similarly, insignificant means “unimportant” and
insignificance means “lack of importance.”

- [[insignia]] 

 A badge of authority or honor; a distinguishing sign or mark. 

•  Peering  closely  at  the  photograph,  he  could  now  see  clearly  the  insignia  of  the  Nazi  SS  on  his
grandfather's chest. 

Insignia are the official signs of rank, titles, or awards. Medals are an example, as are the crowns of
monarchs. The Catholic church employs such insignia as the red robes of cardinals. U.S. presidents
have the presidential seal, which appears on the stand when they're giving a speech. But most of us
think first of the bars, stripes, badges, and patches of military rank.

- [[signatory]] 
government that agrees with others to abide by a signed agreement. 

 A person or government that signs an agreement with others; especially a

•  More  than  a  dozen  countries  were  signatories  to  the  agreement  setting  limits  on  fishing  in
international waters. 

A signatory puts his or her signature on a document that is also signed by others. In 1215 the English
barons revolted against King John and forced him to join them as a signatory to the Magna Carta. This
agreement  stated  the  barons'  own  duties  to  the  King  but  also  assigned  the  barons  clear  rights  and
limited the King's power over them. Though the Magna Carta did nothing for the common people, it's
often been called the first step toward democracy in the English-speaking countries.

- [[signet]] 
document. (2) A small engraved seal, often in the form of a ring. 

  (1)  A  seal  used  instead  of  a  signature  to  give  personal  or  official  authority  to  a

•  The  charters  of  lands  and  rights  of  the  early  American  colonies  were  confirmed  with  the  king's
signet. 

Signets have been used for thousands of years. The design of a signet is personalized for its owner,
and  no  two  are  alike.  The  ancients  used  signets  to  mark  their  possessions  and  to  sign  contracts.  In
later years signets were used to stamp a blob of hot wax sealing a folded secret document so that it
couldn't be opened and read without the design being broken. The Pope still wears a signet, called the
Fisherman's Ring, which is carved with a figure of St. Peter encircled with the Pope's name; after a
Pope's death, the ring is destroyed and a new one is made.
