QUADR/QUART comes from Latin words meaning “four” or “fourth.” In English, a quart is one-
fourth of a gallon, just as a quarter is one-fourth of a dollar. A quadrangle has four sides and angles
but isn't necessarily square. And quadruplets are four babies born at the same time.

- [[quadrant]] 
divided by two lines intersecting at right angles. 

 (1) A quarter of a circle. (2) Any of the four quarters into which something is

•  Washington,  D.C.,  like  a  number  of  other  cities,  is  divided  into  quadrants  called  Northwest,
Northeast, Southwest, and Southeast. 

This word is used for a traditional instrument, used to make calculations of altitude and traditionally
employed  by  sailors  to  navigate,  which  has  a  piece  shaped  like  a  quarter  of  a  circle.  A  quadrant
shower  is  a  shower  that  fits  snugly  into  a  bathroom  corner  and  displays  a  curved  front,  making  a
quadrant  shape  on  the  floor.  But  perhaps  quadrant  is  used  most  often  today  to  name  a  particular
quarter of a city.

- [[quadrille]] 
patterns for four couples. 

  A  square  dance  popular  in  the  18th  and  19th  century,  made  up  of  five  or  six

• Quadrilles were very popular at balls in the American South before the Civil War. 

The quadrille, named for its four couples that form the sides of a square, seems to have begun as a
French  country  dance.  In  the  18th  century  it  became  fashionable  among  the  French  nobility;  as
performed  by  elegantly  dressed  aristocrats,  it  became  slow  and  formal.  It  crossed  over  to  England
and  from  there  to  New  England,  where  it  turned  back  into  a  dance  for  the  common  people.  It  soon
evolved into the American square dance, a lively type of dance that employs a “caller” to make sure
everyone remembers the steps.

- [[quadriplegic]] 

 Paralyzed in both arms and both legs. 

• A motorcycle accident in her teens had killed her boyfriend and left her a quadriplegic. 

Quadriplegia is the result of injury or illness, almost always affecting the spine. Though a paraplegic
has lost the use only of his or her legs, quadriplegics are paralyzed in all four limbs. Today voice-
activated  wheelchairs  help  the  quadriplegic  get  around,  and  houses  can  be  equipped  with  similar
systems to operate lights and appliances; monkeys have even been trained to assist quadriplegics with
everyday  tasks.  The  work  of  the  quadriplegic  actor  Christopher  Reeve  has  led  to  remarkable
advances  in  developing  new  nerve  connections,  enabling  some  determined  paraplegics  and
quadriplegics to walk again.

- [[quartile]] 

 One of four equal groups each containing a quarter of a statistical population. 

•  The  schools  in  our  town  always  average  in  the  lowest  quartile  in  both  reading  and  math
achievement. 

A quartile is a quarter of a specific group that has been tested or evaluated in specific ways. The first
quartile  is  the  one  that  scores  highest  and  the  fourth  quartile  scores  lowest.  For  achievement  and
proficiency  tests,  the  first  quartile  is  the  place  to  be;  for  blood  pressure  or  cholesterol,  the  third
quartile is healthier.

- TETR  comes  from  the  Greek  word  for  “four.”  In  the  immensely  popular  video  game  Tetris,  for
