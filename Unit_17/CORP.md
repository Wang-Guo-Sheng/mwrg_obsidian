- CORP comes from corpus, the Latin word for “body.” A corpse is a dead body. A corporation is
also a kind of body, since it may act almost like an individual. And a corps is a “body” of soldiers.

- [[corporeal]] 

 Having or relating to a physical body; substantial. 

• In paintings, angels usually look very much like corporeal beings, often with actual feathered wings.

In  various  religions,  including  Christianity,  corporeal  existence  is  often  called  the  opposite  of
spiritual  existence,  and  corporeal  existence,  unlike  spiritual  existence,  is  often  said  to  be
contaminated with evil. The word is also often used by philosophers, especially when considering the
nature  of  reality.  For  lawyers,  corporeal  describes  physical  property  such  as  houses  or  cars,  as
opposed to something valuable but nonphysical like a good reputation.

- [[corpulent]] 

 Having a large, bulky body; obese. 

•  Squire  Jenkins  had  often  been  described  as  “stout”  or  “portly,”  but  more  recently  the  word  his
acquaintances were using was usually “corpulent,” or even “fat.” 

The Duchess of Windsor may have said that you can never be too rich or too thin, but that's a rather
modern point of view. In earlier times in Europe, being overweight was considered a sign of wealth
and well-being, as demonstrated by the corpulence of many European kings. Still today, corpulence is
thought to be superior to thinness in some of the world's cultures. But corpulent and corpulence are
less  often  used  than  they  once  were,  and  we're  now  probably  more  likely  to  say  “obese”  and
“obesity.”

- [[corporal]] 

 Relating to or affecting the body. 

•  She  was  reminded  that,  in  the  public-school  system,  shaking  a  child  was  now  regarded  as
unacceptable corporal punishment. 

The  adjective  corporal  today  usually  appears  in  the  phrase  corporal  punishment,  which  means
“bodily punishment.” This used to include such acts as mutilation, branding, imprisonment, and even
death.  But  today  execution  comes  under  the  separate  heading  of  “capital  punishment,”  which
originally involved losing your head (capit- [[meaning]] “head”). Milder forms of corporal punishment
are used by American parents, and were once common in schools as well. Corporal is occasionally
used  in  other  ways;  in  the  traditional  church,  the  “corporal  works  of  mercy”  include  seven  helpful
acts such as sheltering the homeless and burying the dead. Corporal as a military rank actually comes
from caporal—which has the same root as capital.

- [[incorporate]] 
whole. (2) To form or form into a corporation. 

 (1) To blend or combine into something already existing to form one

•  The  new  edition  incorporates  many  suggestions  and  corrections  received  by  the  author  from  his
readers. 

From  its  roots,  incorporate  means  basically  “add  into  a  body”  or  “form  into  a  body.”  So,  for
example, a chef might decide to incorporate a couple of new ingredients into an old recipe, and then
might incorporate that new item into the restaurant's dinner menu. The restaurant itself was probably
incorporated at the beginning, and so is now a corporation—that is, a “body” that's legally allowed
to act like a single person in certain ways, even if it may have many individual employees. As you
can see, the two meanings turn out to be fairly different.

- TANG/TACT comes from the Latin words tangere, “to touch,” and tactus, “sense of touch.” So, for
