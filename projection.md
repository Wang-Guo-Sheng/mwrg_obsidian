An  estimate  of  what  might  happen  in  the  future  based  on  what  is happening now. 

•  The  president  has  been  hearing  different  deficit  projections  all  week  from  the  members  of  his economic team. 

Projection has various meanings, but what they all have in common is that **something is sent out or
forward**.  A  movie  is  projected  onto  a  screen;  a  skilled  actress  projects  her  voice  out  into  a  large theater without seeming to shout; and something **sticking out** from a wall can be called a projection. But the meaning we focus on here is the one used by businesses and governments. Most projections of this kind are estimates of a company's sales or profits—or of the finances of a town, state, or country—sometime in the future.
