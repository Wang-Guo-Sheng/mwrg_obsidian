- AER/AERO  comes  from  the  Greek  word  for  “air.”  The  aerospace  industry  manufactures  vehicles
that travel through the atmosphere and beyond into space. Aerodynamic designs move through the air
with  maximum  speed.  And  aerophobia  is  the  technical  name  for  what  we  usually  just  call  fear  of
flying.

- [[aerial]] 

 (1) Performed in the air. (2) Performed using an airplane. 

• They're doing an aerial survey of the whale population, which involves scanning the ocean's surface
from an airplane. 

Shakespeare himself may have coined this word, in Othello, and later he gave the name Ariel to the
famous air-spirit character in The Tempest. An aerialist is an acrobat who performs high above the
audience. In painting, aerial perspective is the way an artist creates the illusion that a mountain or
city is far away (something that early painters only slowly learned how to do), usually by making it
slightly misty and bluish gray—as if seen through miles of air. An aerial work platform, or “cherry
picker,” supports a worker at a high elevation on the end of a crane. And aerial itself can be used as a
noun,  meaning  a  TV  antenna,  a  forward  pass  in  football,  or  a  high-flying  stunt  performed  by  a
skateboarder or snowboarder.

- [[aerate]] 

 To supply with air or oxygen. 

• The garden soil was well aerated, since they had recently plowed in all the compost and manure and
even added a box of earthworms. 

Faucet aerators and aerating showerheads can be easily installed by homeowners to cut water (and
especially hot water) use by as much as 50%. A lawn aerator removes little plugs of soil in order to
let air deep into the soil, greatly improving the quality of soil that may have gotten too compacted.
And a pond aerator, such as a fountain, is a necessity for an ornamental pond with no stream feeding
it, since oxygen in the water is necessary to prevent the growth of algae and allow fish to live.

- [[aerobic]] 
increasing oxygen consumption. 

  (1)  Living  or  occurring  only  in  the  presence  of  oxygen.  (2)  Involving  or

•  Trainers  measure  a  person's  aerobic  capacity  by  means  of  the  VO2  max  (“maximum  volume  of
oxygen”) test. 

Aerobic exercise is exercise that takes an extended amount of time—usually ten minutes or more—but
is  usually  performed  at  only  moderate  intensity.  Running,  swimming,  bicycling,  and  cross-country
skiing are classic aerobic exercises. In 1968 a best-selling book called Aerobics introduced a system
of  exercise  for  increasing  the  body's  ability  to  take  in  and  use  oxygen,  and  today  aerobics  classes,
often  mimicking  such  outdoor  exercise  as  running  and  bicycling,  take  place  every  afternoon  in
thousands of gyms and YMCAs across the country. Aerobic exercise particularly strengthens the heart
and lungs, but usually has many other good effects as well. Aerobic bacteria, which need oxygen to
live,  are  essential  for  breaking  down  living  matter  so  that  it  returns  to  the  soil.  They  include  the
famous intestinal E. coli, as well as the staph and strep bacteria that can make a visit to the hospital
risky.

- [[anaerobic]] 
in which the body works temporarily with inadequate oxygen. 

 (1) Living or occurring in the absence of oxygen. (2) Relating to activity

• He's never run a mile in his life, and everything he does at the gym is anaerobic. 

In Greek, the prefix a- [[or]] an- means “not” or “without,” and bios means “life.” Anaerobic sports and
exercise, such as gymnastics, weight lifting, and sprinting, are of high intensity but short duration, so
they  don't  involve  much  oxygen  intake.  Anaerobic  exercise  triggers  a  different  type  of  cell  activity
from aerobic exercise. As a result, it doesn't do much for your heart and lungs and it doesn't burn off
fat; what it does do is build muscle. Anaerobic bacteria are bacteria that live without oxygen. They're
responsible for several nasty conditions, including tetanus, gangrene, botulism, and food poisoning.
They often live in deep wounds, so a bad dog bite—or, even worse, a human bite—can be dangerous,
since the mouth is full of anaerobic bacteria. But most anaerobic bacteria are harmless, and many are
essential to our lives.
