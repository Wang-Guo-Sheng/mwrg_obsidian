TOXI comes from the Greek and Latin words for “poison,” something the Greeks and Romans knew
a good deal about. Socrates died by taking a solution of poison hemlock, a flowering plant much like
wild carrot that now also grows in the U.S. Rome's enemy Mithridates, king of Pontus, was obsessed
with  poisons,  experimented  with  them  on  prisoners,  and  tried  to  make  himself  immune  to  them  by
eating  tiny  amounts  of  them  daily.  Nero's  mother  Agrippina  poisoned  several  of  her  son's  rivals  to
power—and probably did the same to her own husband, the emperor Claudius.

- [[toxin]] 
poisonous to other organisms. 

  A  substance  produced  by  a  living  organism  (such  as  bacteria)  that  is  highly

•  Humans  eat  rhubarb  stems  without  ill  effects,  while  cattle  may  die  from  eating  the  leaves,  which
seem to contain two different toxins. 

Long before chemists started creating poisons from scratch, humans were employing natural toxins for
killing weeds and insects. For centuries South American tribes have used the toxin curare, extracted
from  a  native  vine,  to  tip  their  arrows.  The  garden  flower  called  wolfsbane  or  monkshood  is  the
source of aconite, an extremely potent toxin. The common flower known as jimsonweed contains the
deadly poison scopolamine. And the castor-oil plant yields the almost unbelievably poisonous toxin
called  ricin.  Today  we  hear  health  advisers  of  all  kinds  talk  about  ridding  the  body  of  toxins;  but
they're  usually  pretty  vague  about  which  ones  they  mean,  and  most  of  these  “toxins”  wouldn't  be
called that by biologists.

- [[toxicity]] 

 The state of being poisonous; the degree to which something is poisonous. 

• Though they had tested the drug on animals, they suspected the only way to measure its toxicity for
humans was by studying accidental human exposures. 

Toxicity is often a relative thing; in the words of a famous old saying, “The dose makes the poison.”
Thus, it's possible to die from drinking too much water, and lives have been saved by tiny doses of
arsenic. Even though botulinum toxin is the most toxic substance known, it's the basic ingredient in
Botox, which is injected into the face to get rid of wrinkles. With some poisons, mere skin contact can
be  lethal;  others  are  lethal  when  breathed  into  the  lungs  in  microscopic  amounts.  To  determine  if  a
chemical will be officially called a poison, researchers often use the “LD50” test: If 50 milligrams of
the  substance  for  every  kilogram  of  an  animal's  body  weight  results  in  the  death  of  50%  of  test
animals, the chemical is a poison. But there are problems with such tests, and toxicity remains a very
individual concept.

- [[toxicology]] 

 A science that deals with poisons and their effect. 

•  At  medical  school  he  had  specialized  in  toxicology,  hoping  eventually  to  find  work  in  a  crime
laboratory. 

Even  though  most  of  us  are  aware  of  toxicology  primarily  from  crime  shows  on  TV,  toxicologists
actually  do  most  of  their  work  in  other  fields.  Many  are  employed  by  drug  companies,  others  by
chemical companies. Many work for the government, making sure the public is being kept safe from
environmental  poisons  in  the  water,  soil,  and  air,  as  well  as  unhealthy  substances  in  our  food  and
drugs.  These  issues  often  have  to  do  with  quantity;  questions  about  how  much  of  some  substance
should be considered dangerous, whether in the air or in a soft drink, may be left to toxicologists. But
occasionally a toxicology task may be more exciting: for instance, discovering that what looked like
an  ordinary  heart  attack  was  actually  brought  on  by  a  hypodermic  injection  of  a  paralyzing  muscle
relaxant.

- [[neurotoxin]] 

 A poisonous protein that acts on the nervous system. 

•  From  her  blurred  vision,  slurred  speech,  and  muscle  weakness,  doctors  realized  she  had
encountered a neurotoxin, and they suspected botulism. 

The nervous system is almost all-powerful in the body: all five senses depend on it, as do breathing,
digestion,  and  the  heart.  So  it's  an  obvious  target  for  poisons,  and  neurotoxins  have  developed  as
weapons  in  many  animals,  including  snakes,  bees,  and  spiders.  Some  wasps  use  a  neurotoxin  to
paralyze their prey so that it can be stored alive to be eaten later. Snake venom is often neurotoxic (as
in cobras and coral snakes, for example), though it may instead be hemotoxic (as in rattlesnakes and
coppermouths), operating on the circulatory system. Artificial neurotoxins, called nerve agents, have
been developed by scientists as means of chemical warfare; luckily, few have ever been used.

- TEN/TENU comes from the Latin tenuis, meaning “thin.” So to extend something is to stretch it, and
