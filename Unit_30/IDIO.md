- IDIO  comes  from  the  Greek  idios,  meaning  “one's  own”  or  “private.”  In  Latin  this  root  led  to  the
word  idiota,  meaning  “ignorant  person”—that  is,  a  person  who  doesn't  take  in  knowledge  from
outside himself. And that led to a familiar English word that gets used too often, usually to describe
people who aren't ignorant at all.

- [[idiom]] 
but must be learned as a whole. 

 An expression that cannot be understood from the meanings of its separate words

• As a teacher of foreign students, you can't use idioms like “Beats me!” and “Don't jump the gun” in
class unless you want to confuse everyone. 

If you had never heard someone say “We're on the same page,” would you have understood that they
weren't talking about a book? And the first time someone said he'd “ride shotgun,” did you wonder
where the gun was? A modern English-speaker knows thousands of idioms, and uses many every day.
Idioms can be completely ordinary (“first off,” “the other day,” “make a point of,” “What's up?”) or
more  colorful  (“asleep  at  the  wheel,”  “bite  the  bullet,”  “knuckle  sandwich”).  A  particular  type  of
idiom, called a phrasal verb , consists of a verb followed by an adverb or preposition (or sometimes
both); in make over, make out, and make up, for instance, notice how the meanings have nothing to do
with the usual meanings of over, out, and up.

- [[idiomatic]] 

 In a manner conforming to the particular forms of a language. 

• The instructions for assembling the TV probably sounded fine in the original Chinese but weren't
exactly written in idiomatic English. 

The speech and writing of a native-born English-speaker may seem crude, uneducated, and illiterate,
but will almost always be idiomatic—that is, a native speaker always sounds like a native speaker.
For  a  language  learner,  speaking  and  writing  idiomatically  in  another  language  is  the  greatest
challenge.  Even  highly  educated  foreign  learners—professors,  scientists,  doctors,  etc.—rarely
succeed in mastering the kind of idiomatic English spoken by an American 7th-grader.

- [[idiosyncrasy]] 

 An individual peculiarity of a person's behavior or thinking. 

• Mr. Kempthorne, whose idiosyncrasies are well known to most of us, has recently begun walking
around town talking to two ferrets he carries on his shoulders. 

Idiosyncrasies are almost always regarded as harmless. So, for example, filling your house with guns
and  Nazi  posters  might  be  called  something  stronger  than  idiosyncratic.  But  if  you  always  arrange
your Gummi candies in table form by color and type, then eat them in a special order starting with the
pterodactyls  (purple  ones  must  die  first!),  you  might  qualify.  Harmless  though  your  strange  habits
might be, they may not be the kind of thing you'd tell people about; most Americans are careful to hide
their idiosyncrasies, since our culture doesn't seem to value odd behavior. The British, however, are
generally fond of their eccentrics, and English villages seem to be filled with them. By the way, few
words are harder to spell than idiosyncrasy—be careful.

- [[idiopathic]] 

 Arising spontaneously or from an obscure or unknown cause. 

•  After  her  doctor  hemmed  and  hawed  and  finally  described  her  condition  as  “idiopathic,”  she
realized she needed a second opinion. 

Words with the -pathy suffix generally name a disease or condition (see PATH), so you might think
idiopathic  should  describe  a  disease  or  condition  that's  unique  to  an  individual.  But  the  word  is
actually generally used to describe any medical condition that no one has yet figured out. Most facial
tics  are  called  idiopathic  by  doctors,  since  no  cause  can  be  found.  Other  well-known  conditions,
including  chronic  fatigue  syndrome,  irritable  bowel  syndrome,  and  fibromyalgia,  still  perplex  the
medical community. And even though doctors expect that the causes of all of them will eventually be
found,  and  that  those  causes  will  turn  out  to  be  the  same  for  hundreds  of  thousands  of  people,  the
conditions are still called idiopathic.

- AER/AERO  comes  from  the  Greek  word  for  “air.”  The  aerospace  industry  manufactures  vehicles
