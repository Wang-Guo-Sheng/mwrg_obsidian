- CAD  comes  from  the  Latin  verb  cadere,  “to  fall.”  Thus,  a  cascade  is  usually  a  waterfall,  but
sometimes a flood of something else that seems to pour on top of you: a cascade of new problems, a
cascade of honors, and so on.

- [[cadaver]] 

 A dead body, especially one that is to be dissected; a corpse. 

•  The  cadaver  she  was  given  to  work  on,  from  the  Manhattan  morgue,  was  that  of  an  unclaimed
homeless woman. 

Since a corpse is a body that has “fallen down dead,” the root cad- [[seems]] at home here. For most of
us, cadaver has an impersonal sound, and indeed the word is often used for a body whose identity
isn't  important:  most  medical  students  probably  don't  spend  much  time  wondering  who  they're
dissecting. Someone with cadaverous features looks like a corpse before he or she is dead.

- [[decadent]] 

 Marked by decay or decline, especially in morals. 

• The French empire may have been at its most decadent just before the French Revolution. 

To be decadent is to be in the process of decay, so a powerful nation may be said to be in a decadent
stage if its power is fading. But the word is more often used to speak of moral decay. Ever since the
Roman empire, we've tended to link Rome's fall to the moral decay of its ruling class, who indulged
in extreme luxuries and unwholesome pleasures while providing the public with cruel spectacles such
as the slaughter of the gladiators. But not everyone agrees on what moral decadence looks like (or
even  how  it  might  have  hastened  the  fall  of  Rome),  though  most  people  think  it  involves  too  many
sensual pleasures—as, for instance, among the French and English poets and artists of the 1880s and
'90s called the Decadents. These days, for some reason, people have decided decadent is the way to
describe rich chocolate cakes.

- [[cadence]] 
of rest. (2) The rhythmic flow of sound in language. 

 (1) The close of a musical phrase, especially one that moves to a harmonic point

•  As  the  piano  came  to  a  cadence,  the  singer  ascended  to  a  beautiful  high  note,  which  she  held  for
several seconds until the piano came in again in a new key. 

Most of us hear the ending of a piece of music as a fall to a resting place, even if the melody ends on
a high note. And that's the way endings were being heard way back in the 16th century, when cadence
first  began  to  be  used  in  English  for  musical  endings.  Most  cadences  are  harmonic  “formulas”
(standard harmonic patterns that we've all heard thousands of times) and we don't expect them to be
original;  so  whether  you're  consciously  aware  of  it  or  not,  a  cadential  passage  is  usually  quite
recognizable.  When  cadence  means  “speech  rhythm,”  its  cad-  root  refers  to  the  way  the  accents
“fall.”

- [[cadenza]] 
occurs shortly before the end of a piece or movement. 

 A virtuosic flourish or extended passage by a soloist, often improvised, that

• Each of her arias was greeted with greater applause, but it was the brilliant improvised cadenza of
her final number that brought down the house. 

A concerto is a large piece for an instrumental soloist (usually playing piano or violin) and orchestra.
Concertos are often extremely demanding for the soloist, but the most difficult part of all may be the
cadenza, when the orchestra drops out completely, leaving the soloist to dazzle the audience with a
set of flourishes, often completely original, right before a movement ends. Cadenzas are also heard in
many vocal arias, especially those of the 18th century. The word, borrowed from Italian, originally
meant “cadence”; thus, the cadenza, even if it lasts for a couple of minutes, is essentially a decoration
of the final important harmonic cadence of the piece.

- TRIB comes from the Latin tribuere, meaning “to give” or “to pay.” So a group that distributes food
