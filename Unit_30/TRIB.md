- TRIB comes from the Latin tribuere, meaning “to give” or “to pay.” So a group that distributes food
passes it out to those in need, and when you contribute to the group you give your money or energy to
it.

- [[tribute]] 
  (1)  Something  (such  as  a  gift  or  speech)  that  is  given  or  performed  to  show
appreciation,  respect,  or  affection.  (2)  Something  that  proves  the  good  quality  or  effectiveness  of
something. 

• Near the end of his speech, he paid tribute to the two pioneers in the field who were in the audience.

Tribute  originally  took  the  form  of  things  given  from  a  weaker  group  to  the  dominant  power  of  a
region—a  bit  like  the  “protection  money”  the  Mafia  gets  from  small  businesses  after  making  them
offers  they  can't  refuse,  though  the  older  form  of  tribute  actually  did  buy  the  weaker  group  some
protection from enemy forces. Tribute could come in the form of valuables, cattle, or even produce,
and might include the loan of warriors to strengthen the ruler's army. But when we “pay tribute” today,
it's  generally  in  the  form  of  praise.  And  when  we  say,  for  instance,  that  a  successful  school  “is  a
tribute to” the vision of its founder, we mean that its success is itself a form of praise for the person
who founded it. And a “tribute band” is a rock group intended to honor a great band of the past.

- [[tributary]] 

 A stream flowing into a larger stream or a lake. 

• The entire expedition had perished of fever attempting to reach the source of one of the Amazon's
great tributaries. 

A  tributary  was  originally  a  person  or  state  that  owed  tribute  to  a  more  powerful  person  or  state.
Ancient China, for instance, had dozens of tributary states, and the emperor would receive elephants
from Siam or young girls from Korea as tribute. Just as a smaller power gave some of its wealth to a
larger power, a small river contributes its waters to a larger one. A tributary can be a tiny stream, but
some  are  immense  rivers.  The  Missouri  River,  for  example,  could  be  called  a  tributary  to  the
Mississippi, even though it's about 2,500 miles long and receives hundreds of tributaries itself.

- [[attribute]] 
a person or thing. 

 (1) To explain by indicating a cause. (2) To regard as likely to be a quality of

• He attributed his long life to a good sense of humor and a glass of wine with lunch and dinner every
day. 

Attribute  means  something  rather  similar  to  “pay  tribute.”  So,  for  example,  an  award  winner  who
pays tribute to an inspiring professor is, in a sense, attributing her success to the professor. Though if
you attribute your fear of dogs to an incident in your childhood, you're not exactly praising the nasty
dog that bit you way back when. The second sense of attribute is slightly different: If you attribute
bad motives to a politician, it means you think he or she is doing things for the wrong reasons (even if
you don't have any proof). When attribute is accented on its first syllable, it's being used as a noun,
usually as a synonym for quality. So, for instance, you may believe that an even temper is an attribute
of the best presidents, or that cheerfulness is your spouse's best attribute.

- [[retribution]] 

 Something given in payment for a wrong; punishment. 

•  The  victims'  families  have  been  clamoring  for  retribution,  sometimes  even  interrupting  the  trial
proceedings. 

With its prefix re-, meaning “back,” retribution  means  literally  “payback.”  And  indeed  we  usually
use  it  when  talking  about  personal  revenge,  whether  it's  retribution  for  an  insult  in  a  high-school
corridor or retribution for a guerrilla attack on a government building. But retribution isn't always so
personal: God takes “divine retribution” on humans several times in the Old Testament, especially in
the great Flood that wipes out almost the entire human race. And retribution for criminal acts, usually
in the form of a prison sentence, is taken by the state, not the victims.

- Words from Mythology and History

halcyon 

 (1) Calm and peaceful. (2) Happy and successful. 

• She looks back fondly on those halcyon childhood days when she and her sisters seemed to inhabit a
magical world where it was always summer. 

For  the  Greeks,  the  halcyon  was  a  bird  (probably  the  kingfisher)  that  was  believed  to  nest  on  the
Mediterranean Sea around the beginning of winter, and had the power to quiet the rough December
waters around Sicily for about two weeks—the “halcyon days.” Thus the adjective halcyon came to
mean calm and serene. Today people especially use it to describe a golden time in their past.

- [[meander]] 
purpose or direction. 

  (1)  To  follow  a  winding  course.  (2)  To  wander  slowly  without  a  specific

•  A  little-used  trail  meanders  through  the  mountains,  crossed  by  cowpaths  onto  which  hikers  often
stray and get lost. 

Now and then, geography contributes an ordinary word to the language. The Greek word maiandros
came  from  the  Maiandros  River  (now  the  Menderes  River)  in  western  Turkey,  which  rises  in  the
mountains and flows 240 miles into the Aegean Sea. Meandering is a natural tendency especially in
slow-moving rivers on flat ground with fine-grained sand, and the Maiandros was well known for its
many  windings  and  wanderings.  Roads  and  trails,  like  rivers,  can  be  said  to  meander,  but  so  can
relaxed music, lazy writing, and idle thoughts.

- [[oedipal]] 
one's father. 

 Relating to an intense emotional relationship with one's mother and conflict with

•  Already  on  her  first  visit  she  sensed  a  tense  oedipal  situation,  with  her  boyfriend  and  his  father
barely getting through dinner without coming to blows. 

In Greek mythology, the king of Thebes, in response to a dreadful prophecy, abandoned his infant son
Oedipus, who was then brought up by shepherds. Grown to manhood, Oedipus slew his father almost
accidentally,  not  recognizing  him,  and  then  married  his  mother.  When  the  shameful  truth  was
discovered,  the  mother  committed  suicide  and  Oedipus  blinded  himself  and  went  into  exile.  The
psychiatrist Sigmund Freud invented the term Oedipus complex to mean a sexual desire that a child
normally feels toward the parent of the opposite sex, along with jealous feelings toward the parent of
the same sex. In Freud's theory (not accepted by everyone today), lingering oedipal feelings are an
essential  source  of  adult  personality  disorder,  and  can  result  in  choosing  a  spouse  who  closely
resembles your father or mother.

- [[ostracize]] 

 To exclude someone from a group by common consent . 

•  Back  in  the  1950s  she  had  been  ostracized  by  her  fellow  country-club  members  for  her  radical
political beliefs. 

In the ancient democracy of Athens, citizens were permitted to vote once a year to exile anyone who
they thought might pose a problem to the city-state. The man with the most votes was banished for ten
years, even if no one had ever made a single charge against him. Voting was done on ostraka—bits of
broken  pottery,  the  Greek  equivalent  of  scrap  paper—and  the  process  was  known  as  ostrakizein.
Today  the  most  common  kind  of  ostracism  is  exclusion  from  a  social  group.  It  can  be  especially
painful in school: no more sleepovers, no more party invitations, just lots of whispering behind your
back.

- [[paean]] 
subject. 

 (1) A song of joy, praise, tribute, or triumph. (2) A work that praises or honors its

• At his retirement party, the beloved president was treated to paeans from friends and employees to
his years at the head of the company. 

Originally  in  ancient  Greece,  a  paian  was  a  choral  hymn  to  Apollo  as  the  god  of  healing.  More
generally, it could be a hymn of thanksgiving, as when, in Homer's Iliad, the followers of Achilles
sing a paean on the death of his enemy Hector. Paeans could be sung at banquets, at public funerals, to
armies departing for battle and fleets leaving the harbor, and in celebrations of military victories.

- [[philippic]] 

 A speech full of bitter condemnation; a tirade. 

•  Every  few  days  he  launches  another  philippic  against  teenagers:  their  ridiculous  clothes,  their
abominable manners, their ghastly music. 

In  351–350  B.C.,  the  great  Greek  orator  Demosthenes  delivered  a  series  of  speeches  against  King
Philip II of Macedon, the so-called philippikoi logoi (“speeches regarding Philip”). Three centuries
later,  in  44–43  B.C.,  the  great  Roman  orator  Cicero  delivered  a  series  of  speeches  against  Mark
Antony,  which  soon  became  known  as  the  philippica  or  orationes  philippicae,  since  they  were
modeled  on  Demosthenes'  attacks.  Splendid  though  both  men's  speeches  were,  Demosthenes  was
eventually exiled by the Macedonians, and Cicero was executed at Mark Antony's orders.

- [[satyr]] 

 A man with a strong desire for many women. 

• Still drinking and womanizing at the age of 70, he likes to think of himself as a satyr rather than an
old goat. 

Satyrs, the minor forest gods of Greek mythology, had the face, torso, and arms of a man, the ears and
tail of a goat, and two goatlike legs. Fond of the pleasures associated with Dionysus (or Bacchus), the
god of wine, they were full of playful and sometimes violent energies, and spent much of their time
chasing  the  beautiful  nature  spirits  known  as  nymphs.  Satyrs  show  up  over  and  over  in  ancient  art.
The  Greek  god  Pan,  with  his  reed  pipes  and  mischievous  delight  in  life,  had  the  appearance  and
character  of  a  satyr  but  greater  powers.  Notice  how  satyr  is  pronounced;  it's  quite  different  from
satire.

- [[zealot]] 

 A fanatical supporter. 

• My girlfriend's father is a religious zealot, so I always find excuses not to have dinner at their house.

In the 1st century A.D., a fanatical sect arose in Judaea to oppose the Roman domination of Palestine.
Known  as  the  Zealots,  they  fought  their  most  famous  battle  at  the  great  fortress  of  Masada,  where
1,000 defenders took their own lives just as the Romans were about to storm the fort. Over the years,
zealot  came  to  mean  anyone  who  is  passionately  devoted  to  a  cause.  The  adjective  zealous  may
describe  someone  who's  merely  dedicated  and  energetic  (“a  zealous  investigator,”  “zealous  about
combating  inflation,”  etc.).  But  zealot  (like  its  synonym  fanatic)  and  zealotry  (like  its  synonym
fanaticism) are used disapprovingly—even while Jews everywhere still honor the memory of those
who died at Masada.
