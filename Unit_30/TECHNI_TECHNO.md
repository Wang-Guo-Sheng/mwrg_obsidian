- TECHNI/TECHNO  comes  from  the  Greek  techne,  meaning  “art,  craft,  skill,”  and  shows  up  in
dozens  of  English  words.  Some,  such  as  technical,  technology,  and  technique,  have  long  been
familiar.  Others,  such  as  techno-thriller,  were  only  coined  in  the  current  computer  age,  which  has
also seen the new cut-down terms techno (for techno-pop, the electronic dance music) and tech (for
technician or technology).

- [[technocrat]] 

 A scientist or technical expert with power in politics or industry. 

•  The  new  president,  a  great  fan  of  science,  had  surrounded  himself  with  an  impressive  team  of
technocrats. 

In  1919  W.  H.  Smyth  coined  the  term  technocracy  to  mean  basically  “management  of  society  by
technical  experts.”  Technocracy  grew  into  a  movement  during  the  Great  Depression  of  the  1930s,
when politicians and financial institutions were being blamed for the economic disaster, and fans of
technocracy claimed that letting technical experts manage the country would be a great improvement.
(They also suggested that dollars could be replaced by “energy certificates” representing energy units
called ergs.) Today technocrat  and  technocratic  are  still  popular  words  for  experts  with  a  highly
rational  and  scientific  approach  to  public  policy  issues.  But  these  experts  aren't  always  the  best
politicians, and when a terrific technological solution to a problem is opposed by a powerful group
or industry, lawmakers find it easier to just ignore it.

- [[technophobe]] 
especially computers. 

 One who fears or dislikes advanced technology or complex devices and

• The new employee was a middle-aged technophobe, who seemed startled every time a new page
popped up on her computer screen. 

The  condition  known  as  technophobia  got  its  name  around  1965  (though  its  synonym  Luddite  had
been around for a long time), and since then we've been flooded with electronic gadgetry. But even
today few people actually understand any electrical technology more complicated than a lightbulb, so
there's still plenty of technophobia around. And it isn't limited to computer users. The explosion of the
atomic bomb made technophobes out of millions of people; and since human-caused climate change
has been a result of technology, it's not surprising that it too has produced a technophobic response.
But if technology turns out to be part of a solution, maybe that will change.

- [[technophile]] 

 One who loves technology. 

• Back in my day, the high-school technophiles subscribed to Popular Mechanics, built ham radios,
and were always taking apart the engines of their clunkers. 

The  word  technophile  came  along  soon  after  technophobe,  which  seemed  to  need  an  antonym.  Its
own synonyms include geek, gearhead, and propeller-head (for the characters in 1950s comic books
who wore propeller beanies to indicate that they were sci-fi fans). Even before American inventors
began amazing the world with their “Yankee ingenuity” in the 19th century, most Americans could be
described as technology lovers. Today, American technophilia may be seen most vividly when a new
version of a popular video game sells millions of copies to young buyers on the day of its release.

- [[pyrotechnic]] 

 Of or relating to fireworks. 

• Her astonishing, pyrotechnic performance in the concerto left the audience dazed. 

You've  read  about  funeral  pyres,  and  you  may  even  have  survived  a  pyromaniac  (“insane  fire-
starting”) stage in your youth, so you might have guessed that pyr means “fire” in Greek. Pyrotechnic
refers  literally  to  fireworks,  but  always  seems  to  be  used  for  something  else—something  just  as
exciting, explosive, dazzling, sparkling, or brilliant. The performances of sports stars and dancers are
often described as pyrotechnic, and a critic may describe the pyrotechnics of a rock guitarist's licks
or a film's camerawork. A pyrotechnic performance is always impressive, but the word occasionally
suggests something more like “flashy” or “flamboyant.”

- LONG comes from Latin longus, which, as you might guess, means “long.” The English word long
