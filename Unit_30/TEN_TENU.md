- TEN/TENU comes from the Latin tenuis, meaning “thin.” So to extend something is to stretch it, and
lots of things get thin when they're stretched. The ten- [[root]] is even seen in pretend, which once meant
to stretch something out above or in front; that something came to be a claim that you were something
that you actually weren't.

- [[tenuous]] 

 Having little substance or strength; flimsy, weak. 

•  It's  a  rather  tenuous  theory,  and  the  evidence  supporting  it  has  been  questioned  by  several
researchers. 

Something tenuous has been stretched thin and might break at any time. A person with a tenuous hold
on his sanity should be watched carefully. If a business is only tenuously surviving, it will probably
go bankrupt in the next recession. If there seems to be only a tenuous connection between two crimes,
it means the investigators have more work to do.

- [[attenuated]] 

 Thinned or weakened. 

• The smallpox shot is an injection of the virus in an attenuated form too weak to produce an actual
case of smallpox. 

A  friendship  can  become  attenuated  if  neither  person  bothers  to  keep  in  touch.  Radio  waves  can
become attenuated by the shape of the landscape, by foliage, by atmospheric conditions, and simply
by distance. Factory workers and rock musicians often use noise-attenuating ear plugs to save their
hearing. To attenuate something isn't to stop it, just to tone it down.

- [[extenuating]] 

 Partially excusing or justifying. 

• A good college rarely accepts someone who has dropped out of high school twice, but in his case
there were extenuating circumstances, including the death of both parents. 

Extenuating is almost always used today before “circumstances.” Extenuating circumstances are an
important  concept  in  the  law.  If  you  steal  to  feed  your  children,  you're  naturally  less  guilty  than
someone  who  steals  just  to  get  richer;  if  you  kill  someone  in  self-defense,  that's  obviously  an
extenuating  circumstance  that  makes  your  act  different  from  murder.  Juries  will  usually  consider
extenuating circumstances (even when they're instructed not to), and most judges will listen carefully
to an argument about extenuating circumstances as well. And they work outside of the courtroom as
well; if you miss your daughter's performance in the middle-school pageant, she may forgive you if it
was because you had to race Tigger to the vet's emergency room.

- [[distended]] 

 Stretched or bulging out in all directions; swelled. 

• All the children's bellies were distended, undoubtedly because of inadequate nutrition or parasites. 

Before  giving  you  a  shot,  the  nurse  may  wrap  a  rubber  tube  around  your  upper  arm  to  distend  the
veins. When the heart isn't pumping properly, the skin of the feet and ankles may become distended. A
doctor  who  notices  that  an  internal  organ  has  become  distended  will  always  want  to  find  out  the
cause. As you can see, distended tends to be a medical term.
