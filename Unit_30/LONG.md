- LONG comes from Latin longus, which, as you might guess, means “long.” The English word long
shows  up  in  many  compound  terms  such  as  long-suffering  (“patiently  enduring  lasting  offense  or
hardship”)  and  long-winded  (“boringly  long  in  speaking  or  writing”),  but  the  long-  root  also
sometimes shows up less obviously. To prolong something is to lengthen it, for example, and a chaise
longue (not lounge!) is “a long reclining chair.”

- [[longitude]] 

 Distance measured by degrees or time east or west from the prime meridian. 

• Checking the longitude, she was surprised to see that the tip of South America is actually east of
New York City. 

The imaginary (but very important) lines of longitude run from the North Pole to the South Pole. Each
is  identified  by  the  number  of  degrees  it  lies  east  or  west  of  the  so-called  prime  meridian  in
Greenwich, England (part of London). A circle is divided into 360°; so, for example, the longitude of
the Egyptian city of Cairo is about 31°E—that is, about 31° east of London. The “long” sense of the
root  may  be  easier  to  see  in  some  uses  of  the  adjective  longitudinal:  A  longitudinal  study  is  a
research  study  that  follows  its  subjects  over  many  long  years,  and  a  longitudinal  engine  is  one  that
drives  a  crankshaft  that  runs  lengthwise  under  a  vehicle  (as  in  rear-wheel-drive  cars)  rather  than
crosswise.

- [[elongate]] 

 (1) To extend the length of; stretch. (2) To grow in length. 

•  When  mammals  gained  the  ability  to  fly,  it  wasn't  by  means  of  feathered  wings;  instead,  over
thousands of years the digits of their “hands” elongated and a web formed between them. 

Elongate  is  often  found  in  scientific  writing,  but  the  adjective  elongated  is  more  common,  and
frequently used to describe body parts in discussions of anatomy. This was even the case when the
superhero  Elongated  Man  made  his  appearance  back  in  1960.  But  some  other  characters  with  the
same powers—Plastic Man, Elastic Lad, and Mr. Fantastic—ended up having longer careers.

- [[longueur]] 

 A dull and boring portion, as of a book. 

•  She  tells  me  the  book  is  extremely  rewarding,  in  spite  of  some  longueurs  during  which  she
occasionally drops off to sleep. 

Longueur comes straight from French, a language based on Latin. When we borrow a foreign word,
it's usually because English doesn't have a really good synonym, which is the case here. Longueur is
used mostly when talking about books, but also when describing lectures and speeches. Like certain
other French words, longueur tends to be used mainly by critics and professors—but lots of us who
aren't either could find plenty of use for it too.

- [[oblong]] 

 Longer in one direction than in the other. 

• Their apartment was awkwardly oblong, with a long skinny hall running past the cramped rooms. 

Oblong is a general but useful term for describing the shape of things such as leaves. There's no such
thing as an oblong circle, since a stretched circle has to be called an oval, and any rectangle that isn't
square is oblong, at least if it's lying on its side (such rectangles can actually be called oblongs). Pills
are  generally  oblong  rather  than  round,  to  slide  down  the  throat  more  easily.  An  oblong  table  will
often fit a living space better than a square or round one with the same area. And people are always
buried in oblong boxes.
