- PARA  is  a  Greek  prefix  usually  meaning  “beside”  or  “closely  related  to.”  So  parallel  lines  run
beside each other. And a Greek paragraphos was originally a line written beside the main text of a
play to show where a new person begins speaking; today we just start a new paragraph on a new
line.

- [[paraphrase]] 
words. 

  To  restate  the  meaning  (of  something  written  or  spoken)  in  different

• She started off the class by asking one of the students to paraphrase the Tennyson poem, to make sure
everyone understood its basic meaning. 

When we paraphrase, we provide a version that can exist beside the original (rather than replace it).
We paraphrase all the time. When you tell a friend what someone else has said, you're almost always
paraphrasing,  since  you're  not  repeating  the  exact  words.  If  you  go  to  hear  a  talk,  you  might
paraphrase the speaker's main points afterward for your friends. And when writing a paper on a short
story, you might start off your essay with a paraphrase of the plot. Paraphrasing is especially useful
when dealing with poetry, since poetic language is often difficult and poems may have meanings that
are hard to pin down.

- [[paralegal]] 

 Of, relating to, or being a trained assistant to a lawyer. 

•  Part  of  the  firm's  business  involved  researching  real-estate  properties,  which  the  senior  lawyers
regarded as paralegal work. 

Much  of  the  work  in  a  law  office  can  be  done  by  paralegal  assistants,  also  called  legal  aides  or
simply paralegals, who work alongside licensed lawyers. Often a paralegal is trained in a narrow
field and then entrusted with it. In this respect, paralegals are similar to paraprofessionals in other
fields,  such  as  engineering.  Paraprofessionals  used  to  be  trained  in  the  office  itself,  but  today  it's
common to study for a paraprofessional certificate or degree at a community college or university.

- [[paramedic]] 
range of emergency services before or during transportation to a hospital. 

  A  specially  trained  medical  technician  licensed  to  provide  a  wide

• Five ambulances had already arrived, and a dozen paramedics were crouched over the victims with
bandages and IVs. 

In  ground  warfare,  wounded  troops  must  usually  be  transported  from  the  front  lines  back  to  field
hospitals,  and  trained  paramedical  personnel—that  is,  nondoctors,  usually  known  as  medics  or
corpsmen—were first widely used in such situations. It took many decades for the wartime model to
be applied effectively to ordinary peacetime medicine. With advances in medical technology (such as
defibrillators,  for  restarting  a  heart  after  a  heart  attack),  paramedics  became  an  essential  part  of
emergency  medicine,  and  today  hundreds  of  thousands  of  people  owe  their  lives  to  paramedics.
Paraprofessionals who work only in hospitals and clinics usually go by other titles.

- [[paramilitary]] 
possible backup military force. 

 Relating to a force formed on a military pattern, especially as a

• In the country's most remote regions, the real power was held by large landowners, who actually
kept paramilitary forces, their own private armies, on their estates. 

This  term  paramilitary  can  take  in  a  wide  range  of  organizations,  but  is  usually  applied  to  forces
formed by a government. Groups opposing a government, even when organized along military lines,
are  more  often  referred  to  as  guerrillas  or  insurgents.  In  countries  with  weak  central  governments
(such  as,  in  recent  times,  Afghanistan,  Somalia,  Iraq,  or  Congo),  warlords  may  form  their  own
paramilitary  forces  and  take  over  all  local  police  and  military  functions.  Paramilitary  often  has  a
sinister  sound  today,  since  it's  also  applied  to  groups  of  off-duty  military  or  police  personnel  who
carry out illegal violence, often at night, with the quiet support of a government.
