- HYPER is a Greek prefix that means “above or beyond,” so hyper- [[often]] means about the same thing
as  super-.  Hyperinflation  is  inflation  that's  growing  at  a  very  high  rate.  To  be  hypercritical  or
hypersensitive  is  to  be  critical  or  sensitive  beyond  the  normal.  And  if  you  hyperextend  a  knee  or
elbow, it means you're actually bending it backward.

- [[hyperactive]] 

 Excessively active. 

• Stephen King's hyperactive imagination has produced dozens of fantastical stories, not to mention
countless nightmares in his readers. 

For  doctors  and  psychologists,  hyperactive  describes  a  condition  with  unpleasant  consequences.
Hyperactive children usually have a very short attention span and can't sit still, and hyperactivity can
lead to difficulty in learning or just get them in trouble for disturbing their classes. But not every high-
spirited  child  is  hyperactive.  Having  a  high  energy  level  is  pretty  normal  for  children,  and  some
parents think that prescribing drugs for hyperactivity is mostly just good for the drug companies.

- [[hyperbole]] 

 Extreme exaggeration. 

• The food at Chez Pierre was good, but it couldn't live up to the hyperbole of the restaurant critics. 

Advertisers and sports commentators make their living by their skillful use of hyperbole. Presenting
each  year's  Superbowl  as  “the  greatest  contest  in  the  history  of  sports”  certainly  qualifies  as
hyperbole,  especially  since  the  final  scores  are  usually  so  lopsided.  Equally  hyperbolic  are
advertisers' claims that this year's new car model is “the revolutionary vehicle you've been waiting
for”  when  it's  barely  different  from  last  year's—which  of  course  was  once  described  in  the  same
glowing terms. Politicians love hyperbole too; some of them seem convinced that calling a new bill
“the worst bill ever passed by Congress” or comparing the president to Hitler is a great way to win
votes.

- [[hypertension]] 

 High blood pressure. 

• Pregnancy is often accompanied by mild hypertension that doesn't threaten the mother's life. 

You  might  have  thought  that  hypertension  was  what  a  movie  audience  feels  near  the  climax  of  a
thriller, but you would have been wrong. High blood pressure—that is high pressure against the walls
of  your  veins  and  arteries  caused  by  blood  flow—often  occurs  when  the  arteries  or  veins  become
blocked or narrowed, making the heart work harder to pump blood. But many cases seem to be the
result of smoking or taking in too much salt, and many are genetically caused. Hypertension is serious,
since it can lead to heart attacks and strokes. Though it often produces no warning symptoms, your
blood pressure can be checked quickly and easily by a nurse. If it's high, it can usually be controlled
by stopping smoking, losing weight, lowering your salt intake, and exercising—and if all else fails,
by medication.

- [[hyperventilate]] 

 To breathe rapidly and deeply. 

• They laughed so hard they began to hyperventilate and feel giddy. 

Hyperventilating can be a response to fear and anxiety. A test pilot who panics and hyperventilates
faces  a  dangerous  situation.  When  the  level  of  carbon  dioxide  in  your  blood  goes  down  and  the
oxygen level goes up, blood vessels constrict because of the chemical changes and the body can't get
enough  oxygen  (even  though  it's  there  in  the  blood),  and  the  pilot  can  become  lightheaded  and  may
even faint. To guard against this, pilots are taught to control their breathing. On the ground, the usual
remedy for hyperventilation is breathing into a paper bag, which raises the level of carbon dioxide
and restores normal breathing.
