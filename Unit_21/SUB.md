SUB means “under.” So a subway runs under the streets, and a submarine moves under the ocean's
surface.  A  subject  is  a  person  under  the  authority  of  another.  A  movie's  subplot  is  lower  in
importance  than  the  main  plot.  Subscribe  once  meant  “to  write  one's  name  underneath,”  so
subscription was the act of signing a document or agreement.

- [[subconscious]] 

 Existing in the mind just below the level of awareness. 

• After dropping three dishes in a week, she began thinking there might be some kind of subconscious
agitation behind her case of butterfingers. 

We're  rarely  aware,  or  at  least  fully  aware,  of  our  subconscious  mental  activity.  But  subconscious
thought does affect our feelings and behavior, and it's often revealed in dreams, artistic expression,
and  slips  of  the  tongue.  The  subconscious  mind  can  be  a  hiding  place  for  anxiety,  a  source  of
creativity, and often the reason behind our own mysterious behavior.

- [[subjugate]] 

 To bring under control and rule as a subject; conquer, subdue. 

• The country's government claimed it was just trying to protect national security, but some saw its
actions as an attempt to subjugate the news media. 

Since jugus means “yoke” in Latin, subjugate means literally “bring under the yoke.” Farmers control
oxen by means of a heavy wooden yoke over their shoulders. In ancient Rome, conquered soldiers,
stripped of their uniforms, might actually be forced to pass under an ox yoke as a sign of submission
to the Roman victors. Even without an actual yoke, what happens to a population that has come under
the  control  of  another  can  be  every  bit  as  humiliating.  In  dozens  of  countries  throughout  the  world,
ethnic  minorities  are  denied  basic  rights  and  view  themselves  as  subjugated  by  their  country's
government, army, and police.

- [[subliminal]] 

 Not quite strong enough to be sensed or perceived consciously. 

• A few worried parents claimed that some heavy-metal songs contain subliminal messages—in the
form of words recorded backwards—that urge young fans to take up devil worship. 

Since the Latin word limen means “threshold,” something subliminal exists just below the threshold
of conscious awareness. The classic example of a subliminal message is “Eat popcorn” flashed on a
movie  screen  so  quickly  that  the  audience  doesn't  even  notice  it  consciously.  Actually,  no  such
advertising has ever been shown to work. But ordinary ads, both in print and on TV, do contain all
kinds of images that shape our response to the product being advertised even when we don't realize it.
Try  looking  carefully  at  some  ads  that  you  like,  in  order  to  discover  how  many  ways  they  may  be
subliminally affecting you.

- [[subversion]] 
within. (2) The corrupting of someone or something by weakening their morals, loyalty, or faith. 

  (1)  An  attempt  to  overthrow  a  government  by  working  secretly  from

• It's sometimes easier for a government to combat attack from outside than subversion from within. 

Subversion is literally the “turning over” of something. In the 1950s and '60s, many people worried
about  communist  subversion  of  the  U.S.  government,  though  they  often  saw  subversive  activities
where none existed. Nondemocratic governments often claim that anyone who disagrees with them or
joins  a  demonstration  is  a  subversive.  But  subversion  isn't  always  quite  so  serious  a  matter;  when
words  like  weekend,  sandwich,  job,  and  camping  started  being  used  by  the  French,  for  example,
some of them began claiming that America was subverting their language.

- HYPER is a Greek prefix that means “above or beyond,” so hyper- [[often]] means about the same thing
