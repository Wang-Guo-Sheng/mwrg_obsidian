- PRE,  one  of  the  most  common  of  all  English  prefixes,  comes  from  prae,  the  Latin  word  meaning
“before” or “in front of.” So a prediction forecasts what will happen before it occurs. The 5:00 TV
news precedes the 6:00 news. And someone with a prejudice against a class of people has judged
them before having even met them.

- [[preclude]] 

 To make impossible beforehand; prevent. 

• If we accept this cash offer from the company, that will preclude our joining in the big suit against it
with the other investors. 

Preclude  is  often  used  in  legal  writing,  where  it  usually  refers  to  making  something  legally
impossible. A new law may be passed by Congress to preclude any suits of a certain kind against a
federal agency, for example. Some judges have found that the warnings on cigarette packs preclude
any suits against the tobacco companies by lung-cancer sufferers. But there are plenty of nonlegal uses
as well. Bad weather often precludes trips to the beach, and a lack of cash might preclude any beach
vacation at all.

- [[precocious]] 

 Showing the qualities or abilities of an adult at an unusually early age. 

• Everyone agrees that their seven-year-old daughter is smart and precocious, but she's also getting
rather full of herself. 

Growing from a child to an adult is like the slow ripening of fruit, and that's the image that gave us
precocious.  The  word  is  based  on  the  Latin  verb  coquere,  meaning  “to  ripen”  or  “to  cook,”  but  it
comes  most  directly  from  the  adjective  praecox,  which  means  “ripening  early  or  before  its  time.”
Precocity  can  occasionally  be  annoying;  but  precocious  children  don't  come  precooked,  only
“preripened.”

- [[predispose]] 
make one more likely to develop a particular disease or physical condition. 

 (1) To influence in advance in order to create a particular attitude. (2) To

• Growing up in a house full of sisters had predisposed her to find her friendships with other women. 

Predispose  usually  means  putting  someone  in  a  frame  of  mind  to  be  willing  to  do  something.  So  a
longtime  belief  in  the  essential  goodness  of  people,  for  example,  will  predispose  us  to  trust  a
stranger.  Teachers  know  that  coming  from  a  stable  family  generally  predisposes  children  to  learn.
And viewing television violence for years may leave young people with a predisposition to accept
real  violence  as  normal.  The  medical  sense  of  the  word  is  similar.  Thus,  a  person's  genes  may
predispose her to diabetes or arthritis, and malnutrition over a long period can predispose you to all
kinds of infections.

- [[prerequisite]] 
out a function. 

 Something that is required in advance to achieve a goal or to carry

• In most states, minimal insurance coverage is a prerequisite for registering an automobile. 

Prerequisite  is  partly  based  on  requirere,  the  Latin  verb  meaning  “to  need  or  require.”  So  a
prerequisite  can  be  anything  that  must  be  accomplished  or  acquired  before  something  else  can  be
done.  Possessing  a  valid  credit  card  is  a  prerequisite  for  renting  a  car.  A  physical  exam  may  be  a
prerequisite  for  receiving  a  life-insurance  policy.  And  successful  completion  of  an  introductory
course is often a prerequisite for enrolling in a higher-level course.

- PARA  is  a  Greek  prefix  usually  meaning  “beside”  or  “closely  related  to.”  So  parallel  lines  run
