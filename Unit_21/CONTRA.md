- CONTRA is the Latin equivalent of anti-, and it too means essentially “against” or “contrary to.” A
contrast  “stands  against”  something  else  that  it's  compared  to.  And  contrapuntal  music,  as  in  the
music of Bach, sets one melody against another played at the same time and produces harmony (which
no one is opposed to).

- [[contraband]] 
a country; smuggled goods. 

 Goods that are forbidden by law to be owned or brought into or out of

•  Late  at  night  he  would  go  driving  through  the  desert  on  the  interstate,  peddling  his  contraband  to
wary gas-station attendants. 

In  Latin  a  bannus  was  an  order  or  decree,  so  a  contrabannum  was  something  that  went  against  a
decree. This led to the Italian word contrabbando, from which we get contraband. Contraband items
aren't always illegal; they may simply be things (such as cigarettes) that are meant to be taxed. So a
dealer in untaxed contraband can charge a little less and still make enormous profits. Of course, if the
item is actually forbidden, like illegal drugs, then the profits could be much greater.

- [[contraindication]] 
makes a particular treatment, medication, or procedure likely to be unsafe. 

  Something  (such  as  a  symptom  or  condition)  that

• A history of stomach ulcers is a contraindication to regular use of aspirin. 

For doctors, an indication  is  a  symptom  or  circumstance  that  makes  a  particular  medical  treatment
desirable.  Serious  anxiety,  for  example,  is  often  an  indication  for  prescribing  a  tranquilizer.  A
contraindication, then, is a symptom or condition that makes a treatment risky, such as taking certain
other medications at the same time. Drugs and conditions that are contraindicated for a medication
are listed on its label, and reeled off at high speed in TV ads. Patients can guard against the dangers
of drug interaction by reading labels carefully and making sure their doctors know what else they're
currently taking.

- [[contravene]] 
argument, to contradict. 

  (1)  To  go  against  or  act  contrary  to;  to  violate.  (2)  To  oppose  in  an

•  The  power  company  was  found  to  be  contravening  state  and  federal  environmental  standards  for
wastewater discharged into bodies of water. 

Contravene is most often used in reference to laws. So a government may take a company to court
claiming that its policies are in contravention of national labor laws. The contravention of copyright
laws is a big topic today especially where electronic information is involved. And a country might be
punished if a trade organization finds that it's contravening international trade agreements.

- [[contrarian]] 
investor who buys shares of stock when most others are selling or sells when others are buying. 

  A  person  who  takes  a  contrary  position  or  attitude,  especially  an

• My father was basically a contrarian, who never accepted the common wisdom and loved nothing
so much as a good argument. 

Anyone who thinks that most of what the public believes is wrong would be called a contrarian. And
contrarian  is  a  basic  term  in  the  vocabulary  of  investing.  In  fact,  most  successful  investors  often
behave  like  contrarians  by  “buying  low  and  selling  high”—that  is,  buying  stocks  that  are  cheap
because  most  investors  put  a  low  value  on  them  but  that  have  the  possibility  of  rising,  and  selling
stocks that most investors are valuing highly but that seem likely to decline. The word may be most
common as an adjective; so you may express a contrarian opinion, hold a contrarian view, or pursue
a contrarian investment strategy.

- Greek and Latin Borrowings

in memoriam 

 In memory of. 

• The message on the pedestal begins “In memoriam” and then lists the names of the local young men
who died in World War I. 

Since the days of the Roman empire, the words In memoriam, followed by a name, have been found
on monuments and gravestones. They may also appear in the dedication of a book or poem; Alfred
Tennyson's greatest poem is his immense In Memoriam, written over a period of 17 years to mourn
the death of his dear friend Arthur Hallam.

- [[magnum]] opus 
composer, or writer. 

 A great work, especially the greatest achievement of an artist,

• No one was exactly sure what the massive novel was about, but everyone was certain that it was his
magnum opus. 

The greatest work of a great artist may be hard to agree on. Many would pick Rembrandt's The Night
Watch, Mozart's Don Giovanni, Ovid's Metamorphoses, Dante's Divine Comedy,  Wren's  St.  Paul's
Cathedral,  and  Michelangelo's  Sistine  Chapel  murals.  But  for  Shakespeare,  would  it  be  Hamlet  or
King Lear? For Mahler, The Song of the Earth  or  the  Ninth  Symphony?  For  the  Marx  Brothers,  A
Day at the Races or A Night at the Opera?

- [[memento]]  mori 
symbolizing death. 

  A  reminder  of  mortality,  especially  a  human  skull

• The first twinges of arthritis often serve as a vivid memento mori for middle-aged jocks trying to
ignore their advancing years. 

Memento mori literally means “Remember you must die.” The early Puritan settlers were particularly
aware of death and fearful of what it might mean, so a Puritan tombstone will often display a memento
mori intended for the living. These death's-heads or skulls may strike us as ghoulish, but they helped
keep  the  living  on  the  straight  and  narrow  for  fear  of  eternal  punishment.  In  earlier  centuries,  an
educated European might place an actual skull on his desk to keep the idea of death always present in
his mind.

- [[habeas]] corpus 
find out if that person should really be in jail. 

 An order to bring a jailed person before a judge or court to

• The country has a primitive legal system with no right of habeas corpus, and suspects often are shot
before they ever see a judge. 

The literal meaning of habeas corpus is “You shall have the body”—that is, the judge must have the
person charged with a crime brought into the courtroom to hear what he's been charged with. Through
much of human history, and in many countries still today, a person may be imprisoned on the orders of
someone  in  the  government  and  kept  behind  bars  for  years  without  ever  getting  a  chance  to  defend
himself, or even knowing what he's done wrong. In England, the right to be brought before a judge to
hear the charges and answer them was written into law over 300 years ago, and the U.S. adopted the
British practice in its Constitution.

- [[rigor]] mortis 

 The temporary rigidity of muscles that sets in after death. 

• The coroner could tell from the progress of rigor mortis that death had occurred no more than six
hours earlier. 

Rigor mortis,  which  translates  from  Latin  as  “stiffness  of  death,”  sets  in  quickly  and  usually  ends
three or four days after death. The condition results from a lack of certain chemicals in the muscles; it
may  be  affected  by  muscular  activity  before  death  as  well  as  the  external  temperature.  Mystery
writers frequently make use of rigor mortis as a means by which the detective or the examiner can
determine the time of the victim's death, which often turns out to be all-important in solving the case.

- [[sine]] qua non 

 An essential thing. 

• Good planning is the sine qua non of a successful dinner party. 

Sine  qua  non  can  be  translated  literally  as  “Without  which,  not.”  Though  this  may  sound  like
gibberish, it means more or less “Without (something), (something else) won't be possible.” Sine qua
non sounds slightly literary, and it shouldn't be used just anywhere. But it actually shows up in many
contexts, including business (“A solid customer base is the sine qua non to success”), show business
(“A good agent is a sine qua non for an actor's career”), and politics (“His support was really the sine
qua non for her candidacy”).

- [[tabula]] rasa 
impressions from outside. (2) Something existing in its original pure state. 

  (1)  The  mind  in  its  blank  or  unmarked  state  before  receiving  any

• As for knowing what life outside of his little village was like, he was practically a tabula rasa. 

In ancient Rome, a student in class would write on a wax-covered wooden tablet, or tabula, using a
sticklike implement. At the end of the day, the marks could be scraped off, leaving a fresh, unmarked
tablet—a tabula rasa—for the next day's lessons. But even before the Romans, the Greek philosopher
Aristotle had called the mind at birth an “unmarked tablet.” We still use the term today, but usually not
very seriously; with what we know about biology and genetics, most of us don't really think there's
nothing in a mind at birth.

- [[terra]] incognita 

 An unexplored country or field of knowledge. 

• We've been to Phoenix once, but otherwise Arizona is terra incognita. 

When Roman mapmakers drew a land area that no one had yet explored, they often labeled it “Terra
Incognita”—that is, “Unknown Territory”—and the term continued to be used for centuries afterward.
When  Columbus  and  his  successors  first  crossed  the  Atlantic,  they  entered  upon  terra  incognita,  a
land that came to be called the “New World.” But the term is just as useful for mental exploration. For
most of us, subjects such as particle physics, French 17th-century drama, and soil mechanics are terra
incognita, and we can only hope to live long enough to be able to explore some of them someday.
