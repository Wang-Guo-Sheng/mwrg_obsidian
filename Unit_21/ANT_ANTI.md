- ANT/ANTI  is  a  Latin  prefix  meaning  “against.”  An  anticlimax  is  the  opposite  of  a  climax.  An
antiseptic or antibiotic fights germs. An antacid attacks acid in the stomach. And an antidote works
against the effects of a poison.

- [[antagonist]] 

 A person who opposes or is unfriendly toward another; an opponent. 

• With supplies ordered from the Acme Company, Road Runner's constant antagonist, Wile E. Coyote,
attempts one dastardly deed after another. 

On the stage or screen, in a story or a novel, the protagonist is the main character and the antagonist
is the opposing one. Pro- [[and]] ant- usually mark the good and bad characters, but not always; there
may  occasionally  be  an  evil  protagonist  and  a  good  antagonist.  In  the  drama  of  the  real  world,  it's
especially  hard  to  sort  out  which  is  which,  so  we  usually  speak  of  both  parties  to  a  conflict  as
antagonists.  During  a  strike,  for  example,  representatives  of  labor  and  management  become
antagonists; they often manage to antagonize each other, and the antagonism often remains after the
strike is over.

- [[antigen]] 
causes the body to form antibodies against it. 

 A chemical substance (such as a protein) that, when introduced into the body,

• When the immune system is weak, it may not be able to produce enough antibodies to combat the
invading antigens. 

An antibody is a protein produced by your immune system to fight outside invaders. Since the enemy
substance  actually  triggers  the  production  of  antibodies,  such  substances  are  called  antigens—anti-
being short for antibody, and -gen meaning “producer.” (In a similar way, an allergen produces an
allergy, and a pathogen produces a pathology or disease.) Antigens are often rodlike structures that
stick out from the surface of an invading organism—usually a bacterium or a virus—and allow it to
attach itself to cells in the invaded body. But unfortunately for them, in doing so they let the immune
system know they're present, and the body is flooded with an army of Pac-Man-like antibodies.

- [[antipathy]] 

 A strong dislike. 

•  It  seemed  odd  that  he  could  feel  such  intense  antipathy  for  someone  he'd  only  met  once,  and  we
suspected there was more to the story. 

When the nation of Yugoslavia was created in 1945, it combined a number of ethnic groups with a
history of violent antipathy toward each other. In 1991–92 four regions of the country announced that
they would become independent nations; a bloody six-year war followed, fueled by these ancient and
powerful  antipathies.  The  American  Civil  War  similarly  resulted  from  antipathy  between  the  North
and  the  South.  But  in  the  U.S.'s  relations  with  its  next-door  neighbors,  it's  been  a  long  time  since
emotions have gotten much stronger than annoyance.

- [[antithesis]] 

 (1) The contrast or opposition of ideas. (2) The exact opposite. 

• Life on the small college campus, with its personal freedom and responsibility, was the antithesis of
what many students had known in high school. 

Writers  and  speechmakers  use  the  traditional  pattern  known  as  antithesis  for  its  resounding  effect;
John  Kennedy's  famous  “ask  not  what  your  country  can  do  for  you—ask  what  you  can  do  for  your
country” is an example. But antithesis normally means simply “opposite.” Thus, war is the antithesis
of  peace,  wealth  is  the  antithesis  of  poverty,  and  love  is  the  antithesis  of  hate.  Holding  two
antithetical ideas in one's head at the same time—for example, that you're the sole master of your fate
but also the helpless victim of your terrible upbringing—is so common as to be almost normal.

- CONTRA is the Latin equivalent of anti-, and it too means essentially “against” or “contrary to.” A
