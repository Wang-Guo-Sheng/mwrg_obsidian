- PER  is  a  Latin  preposition  that  generally  means  “through,”  “throughout,”  or  “thoroughly.”  Thus,
perforate  means  “to  bore  through,”  perennial  means  “throughout  the  years,”  and  permanent  means
“remaining throughout.” And the “thoroughly” sense shows up in persuade, for “thoroughly advise,”
and perverted, “thoroughly turned around.”

- [[percolate]] 
through. 

  (1)  To  trickle  or  filter  through  something  porous.  (2)  To  become  spread

• She tells herself that the money she spends on luxuries eventually percolates down to the needy. 

Percolate comes from a Latin verb meaning “to put through a sieve.” Something that percolates filters
through  something  else,  just  as  small  particles  pass  through  a  sieve.  Water  is  drawn  downward
through the soil, and this percolation usually cleans the water. A slow rain is ideal for percolating
into the soil, since in a violent rainstorm most of it quickly runs off. For this reason, drip irrigation is
the  most  effective  and  water-conserving  form  of  irrigation.  Percolation  isn't  always  a  physical
process;  awareness  of  an  issue  may  percolate  slowly  into  the  minds  of  the  public,  just  as  Spanish
words may gradually percolate into English, often starting in the Southwest.

- [[pervade]] 

 To spread through all parts of something. 

• We all knew that more job cuts were coming, and the entire office was pervaded with anxiety. 

Pervade can be used to describe something physical: a chemical odor may pervade a building, for
example, and most scientists believe that outer space is pervaded by mysterious “dark matter.” But
the  word  usually  doesn't  refer  to  anything  that  could  be  detected  by  scientific  instruments.  Thus,
humor  may  pervade  a  novel,  gloom  may  pervade  a  gathering,  and  corruption  may  pervade  a
government.  And  something  pervasive  exists  in  every  part  of  something:  fatherlessness  may  be  a
pervasive  problem  in  poor  neighborhoods,  for  instance,  and  pervasive  optimism  sometimes  causes
the stock market to soar.

- [[permeate]] 
of. 

 (1) To spread throughout. (2) To pass through the pores or small openings

•  On  Saturday  mornings  back  in  those  days,  the  aroma  of  fresh  pies  and  breads  would  permeate
almost every house on the block. 

Permeate is often a synonym for pervade. We could say, for example, that at exam time the campus is
either “permeated” or “pervaded” by a sense of dread. But the two words aren't identical. For one
thing, permeate can mean simply “pass through,” and is often used when talking about liquids; thus, a
boot can be permeated by water, though certain oils make leather less permeable, and you might just
want to buy boots made of impermeable  material.  And  things  may  “pass  through”  in  a  nonphysical
way  as  well;  so  you  might  say  that  anxiety  about  climate  change  has  started  to  permeate  into  the
public's consciousness—but once anxiety has become pervasive it's pretty much taken over.

- [[persevere]] 

 To keep at something in spite of difficulties, opposition, or discouragement.

• For ten years she persevered in her effort to find out what the government knew about her husband's
disappearance. 

The  early  settlers  of  the  New  World  persevered  in  the  face  of  constant  hardship  and  danger.  The
Pilgrims of Plymouth Plantation lost half their number in the first winter to disease and hunger, but
their perseverance  paid  off,  and  within  five  years  their  community  was  healthy  and  self-sufficient.
Perhaps more remarkable are all the solitary inventors who have persevered in pursuing their visions
for years, lacking any financial support and laughed at by the public.
