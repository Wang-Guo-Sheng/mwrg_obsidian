- META is a prefix in English that generally means “behind” or “beyond.” In medicine, for example,
the metacarpal bones are the hand bones that come right after, or beyond, the carpal or wrist bones.
And  metalanguage  is  language  used  to  talk  about  language,  which  requires  going  beyond  normal
language.

- [[metadata]] 

 Data that provides information about other data. 

• Before putting videos up on the Web site, she always tags them with a decent set of metadata. 

Metadata is electronic data that somehow describes an electronic file or its contents, and is usually
included in the file itself. An important use for metadata is for searching. A piece of metadata might
identify  the  file,  its  size,  the  date  it  was  compiled,  its  nature,  and  so  on.  Metadata  is  particularly
important  for  making  pictures  searchable;  since  a  picture  of  a  landscape  in  the  Southwest,  for
example,  can't  be  “read”  by  a  search  engine,  data  tags  such  as  “Southwest,”  “mesa,”  and  “arroyo”
might  be  included  in  the  digitized  image  file.  The  same  can  be  done  for  audio  files;  the  tags  for  a
speech  might  read  “Gore,”  “climate,”  and  “Copenhagen.”  Metadata  tags  for  a  Web  page,  including
tags  identifying  its  most  important  content,  ensure  that  the  page  won't  be  overlooked  by  a  search
engine.

- [[metaphorical]] 
one kind of object or idea is used in place of another to suggest a similarity between them. 

 Relating to a figure of speech in which a word or phrase meaning

• He always points out to his classes that metaphors can be found in poetry of all kinds, from “The
eyes are the windows of the soul” to “You ain't nothin' but a hound dog.” 

Metaphor  comes  from  a  Greek  word  meaning  “transfer”  (or,  to  stay  close  to  its  roots,  “carry
beyond”). Thus, a metaphor transfers the meaning of one word or phrase to another. Metaphors often
include a form of the verb be (as in the examples above), and they're often contrasted with similes,
which are usually introduced by like or as (“O, my luve's like a red, red rose”). But, they don't have
to include be; when you say that the teacher gave us a mountain of homework or that we're drowning
in paperwork, these too are metaphorical statements.

- [[metaphysics]] 
nature of things. 

 The part of philosophy having to do with the ultimate causes and basic

•  Most  of  the  congregation  prefers  to  hear  their  minister  preach  about  virtue,  and  they  get  restless
when his sermons head in the direction of metaphysics. 

Just as physics  deals  with  the  laws  that  govern  the  physical  world  (such  as  those  of  gravity  or  the
properties of waves), metaphysics describes what is beyond physics—the nature and origin of reality
itself,  the  immortal  soul,  and  the  existence  of  a  supreme  being.  Opinions  about  these  metaphysical
topics vary widely, since what's being discussed can't be observed or measured or even truly known
to exist. So most metaphysical questions are still as far from a final answer as they were when Plato
and Aristotle were asking them.

- [[metonymy]] 
of something else that is associated with it or related to it. 

 A figure of speech in which the name of one thing is used for the name

•  When  Wall  Street  has  the  jitters,  the  White  House  issues  a  statement,  and  the  people  wait  for
answers from City Hall, metonymy is having a busy day. 

At  first  glance,  metaphor  and  metonymy  seem  close  in  meaning,  but  there  are  differences.  In  a
metaphor we substitute one thing for something else that's usually quite different; for example, Web for
a worldwide network of linked computers and their technology. In metonymy, we replace one word or
phrase (such as “stock market” or “local government officials” in the examples above) with another
word or phrase associated with it. Most familiar metonyms are place-names, such as Hollywood for
“the film industry,” or K Street for “Washington lobbyists.” But saying “the press” to refer to the news
media, or “sweat” to refer to hard work, could also be called metonymy.

- PER  is  a  Latin  preposition  that  generally  means  “through,”  “throughout,”  or  “thoroughly.”  Thus,
