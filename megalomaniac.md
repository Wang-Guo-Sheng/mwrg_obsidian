自大狂，刚愎自用之君

A  mental  disorder  marked  by  feelings  of  great  personal power and importance. 

• When the governor started calling for arming his National Guard with nuclear weapons, the voters finally realized they had elected a megalomaniac. 

Since the Greek root *megalo-*  means “**large**,” someone who is [[megalomaniacal]] has a mental disorder marked by feelings of **personal grandeur**. Megalomania has probably afflicted many rulers throughout
history: The Roman emperor Caligula insisted that he be worshipped as a living god. Joseph Stalin suffered from the paranoia that often accompanies megalomania, and had thousands of his countrymen executed as a result. J.-B. Bokassa, dictator of a small and extremely poor African nation, proclaimed himself  emperor  of  the  country  he  renamed  the  Central  African  Empire.  And  even  democratically
elected  leaders  have  often  acquired  huge  egos  as  a  result  of  public  acclaim.  But megalomaniac  is generally thrown around as an **insult** and rarely refers to real mental illness.
