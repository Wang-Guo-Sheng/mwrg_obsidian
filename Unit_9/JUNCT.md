- JUNCT comes from the Latin verb jungere, meaning “to join.” A junction is a place where roads or
railways come together. A conjunction is a word that joins two other words or groups of words: “this
and that,” “to be or not to be.”

- [[juncture]] 
junction. 

 (1) An important point in a process or activity. (2) A place where things join:

• The architect claims his design for the new Islamic Museum represents a juncture of Muslim and
Western culture. 

The meaning of juncture can be entirely physical; thus, you can speak of the juncture of the turnpike
and  Route  116,  or  the  juncture  of  the  Shenandoah  and  Potomac  Rivers.  But  it  more  often  means
something nonphysical. This may be a moment in time, especially a moment when important events
are “crossing” (“At this critical juncture, the President called together his top security advisers”). But
juncture  also  often  refers  to  the  coming  together  of  two  or  more  ideas,  systems,  styles,  or  fields
(“These  churches  seem  to  operate  at  the  juncture  of  religion  and  patriotism,”  “Her  job  is  at  the
juncture of product design and marketing,” etc.).

- [[adjunct]] 

 Something joined or added to another thing of which it is not a part. 

• All technical-school students learn that classroom instruction can be a valuable adjunct to hands-on
training. 

With its prefix, ad-, meaning “to or toward,” adjunct implies that one thing is “joined to” another. A
car wash may be operated as an adjunct to a gas station. An adjunct professor is one who's attached
to the college without being a full member of the salaried faculty. And anyone trying to expand his or
her  vocabulary  will  find  that  daily  reading  of  a  newspaper  is  a  worthwhile  adjunct  to  actual
vocabulary study.

- [[disjunction]] 

 A break, separation, or sharp difference between two things. 

• By now she realized there was a serious disjunction between the accounts of his personal life that
his two best friends were giving her. 

A disjunction may be a mere lack of connection between two things, or a large gulf. There's often a
huge disjunction between what people expect from computers and what they know about them, and the
disjunction between a star's public image and her actual character may be just as big. We may speak
of the disjunction between science and morality, between doing and telling, or between knowing and
explaining. In recent years, disjunction seem to have been losing out to a newer synonym, the noun
disconnect.

- [[conjunct]] 

 Bound together; joined, united. 

• Politics and religion were conjunct in 18th-century England, and the American colonists were intent
on separating the two. 

With its prefix con-, meaning “with, together,” conjunct means basically “joined together.” A rather
intellectual  word,  it  has  special  meanings  in  music  (referring  to  a  smooth  melodic  line  that  doesn't
skip up or down) and astronomy (referring to two stars or planets that appear next to each other), but
its more general “bound together” meaning is rarer. A conjunction is a word (particularly and, or, or
but) that joins together words or groups of words, and an adverb that joins two clauses or sentences
(such as so, however, meanwhile, therefore, or also)  is  called  a  conjunctive adverb—or  simply  a
conjunct.

- PART,  from  the  Latin  word  pars,  meaning  “part,”  comes  into  English  most  obviously  in  our  word
