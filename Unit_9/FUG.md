- FUG comes from the Latin verb fugere, meaning “to flee or escape.” Thus, a refugee flees from some
threat or danger, while a fugitive is usually fleeing from the law.

- [[centrifugal]] 

 Moving outward from a center or central focus. 

• Their favorite carnival ride was the Round-up, in which centrifugal force flattened them against the
outer wall of a rapidly spinning cage. 

Centrifugal  force  is  what  keeps  a  string  with  a  ball  on  the  end  taut  when  you  whirl  it  around.  A
centrifuge  is  a  machine  that  uses  centrifugal  force.  At  the  end  of  a  washing  machine's  cycle,  it
becomes a weak and simple centrifuge as it whirls the water out of your clothes. Centrifuges hundreds
of thousands of times as powerful are essential to nuclear technology and drug manufacturing. Part of
an astronaut's training occurs in a centrifuge that generates force equal to several times the force of
gravity (about like a washing machine) to get them used to the forces they'll encounter in a real space
mission.

- [[refuge]] 
protection. 

 Shelter or protection from danger or distress, or a place that provides shelter or

• Caught in a storm by surprise, they took refuge in an abandoned barn. 

The  re-  in  refuge  means  basically  “back”  or  “backward”  rather  than  “again”  (see  RE-);  thus,  a
refugee is someone who is “fleeing backward.” Refuge tends to appear with certain other words: you
generally “seek refuge,” “take refuge,” or “find refuge.” Religion may be a refuge from the woes of
your  life;  a  beautiful  park  may  be  a  refuge  from  the  noise  of  the  city;  and  your  bedroom  may  be  a
refuge from the madness of your family.

- [[fugue]] 
enter one after another and interweave as the piece proceeds. 

 A musical form in which a theme is echoed and imitated by voices or instruments that

• For his debut on the church's new organ, the organist chose a fugue by J. S. Bach. 

Bach  and  Handel  composed  many  fugues  for  harpsichord  and  organ  in  which  the  various  parts  (or
voices) seem to flee from and chase each other in an intricate dance. Each part, after it has stated the
theme or melody, apparently flees from the next part, which takes up the same theme and sets off in
pursuit. Simple rounds such as “Three Blind Mice” or “Row, Row, Row Your Boat” could be called
fugues for children, but a true fugue can be long and extremely complex.

- [[subterfuge]] 
trick. 

 (1) A trick designed to help conceal, escape, or evade. (2) A deceptive

• The conservatives' subterfuge of funding a liberal third-party candidate in order to take votes away
from the main liberal candidate almost worked that year. 

With its “flee” root, the Latin verb subterfugere meant “to escape or avoid.” Thus, a subterfuge is a
way of escaping blame, embarrassment, inconvenience—or even prison—by tricky means. The life of
spies  consists  of  an  endless  series  of  subterfuges.  In  the  more  everyday  world,  putting  words  like
“heart-healthy” on junk-food packaging is a subterfuge to trick unwary shoppers. And getting a friend
to  call  about  an  “emergency”  in  order  to  get  out  of  an  evening  engagement  is  about  the  oldest
subterfuge in the book.
