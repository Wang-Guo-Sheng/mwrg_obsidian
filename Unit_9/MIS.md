- MIS comes from the Latin verb mittere, “to send.” A missile is something sent speeding through the
air or water. And when your class is dismissed at the end of the day, you're sent home.

• She considers it her mission to prevent unwanted puppies and kittens from being born. 

Your own mission in life can be anything you pursue with almost religious enthusiasm. People with a
mission—whether it's stopping drunk driving, keeping the town's public areas clean, increasing local
recycling, or building a community center—very often succeed in really changing things.

- [[missionary]] 

 A person undertaking a mission, and especially a religious missionary. 

• North American missionaries have been working in Central America for decades, and you can find
their churches in even the most remote jungle regions. 

Beginning around 1540, an order of Catholic priests known as the Jesuits began to send its members
to many parts of the world to convert peoples who believed in other gods to Christianity. Wherever
they went, the Catholic missionaries built central buildings for their religious work, and the buildings
themselves  became  known  as  missions;  many  17th-century  missions  in  the  American  West  and
Southwest are now preserved as museums. Their foes, the Protestants, soon began sending out their
own missionaries, and today Protestant missionaries are probably far more numerous.

- [[emissary]] 

 Someone sent out to represent another; an agent. 

• Now in his 70s, he had served over many years as a presidential emissary to many troubled regions
of the world . 

Like  missionaries,  emissaries  are  sent  on  missions.  However,  emissaries  are  more  likely  to  be
representing governments, political leaders, and nonreligious institutions, and an emissary's mission
is usually to negotiate or to gather information. So a president may send a trusted emissary to a war-
torn  region  to  discuss  peace  terms.  A  company's  CEO  may  send  an  emissary  to  check  out  another
company that they may be thinking of buying. And a politician may send out an emissary to persuade a
wealthy individual to become a supporter.

- [[transmission]] 
  (1)  The  act  or  process  of  sending  something  from  one  point  to
another, especially sending electrical signals to a radio, television, computer, etc. (2) The gears by
which the power is passed from the engine to the axle in a motor vehicle. 

• Even in the Middle Ages, transmission of news of a ruler's death across the Asian continent could
be accomplished by sun reflectors within 24 hours. 

Since trans- [[means]] “across” (see TRANS), it's not hard to see the meaning of transmission. Disease
transmission occurs when an infection passes from one living thing to another. TV signal transmission
can be interrupted by tree leaves, including moving leaves and branches during a storm. Your car's
transmission transmits the engine's power to the axle, changing the gears to keep the engine working
with maximum efficiency at various speeds.

- PEL comes from the Latin verb pellere, meaning “to move or drive.” So a propeller moves a small
