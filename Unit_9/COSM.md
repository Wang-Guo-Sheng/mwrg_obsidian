- COSM  comes  from  the  Greek  word  for  “order.”  Since  the  Greeks  believed  the  universe  was  an
orderly place, words in this group usually relate to the universe. So cosmonaut was the word for a
space traveler from the former Soviet Union. (The roots of our own word, astronaut, suggest “star
traveler” instead.) Oddly enough, cosmetics comes from the same root, since putting things in order is
similar to decorating something—such as your face.

- [[cosmos]] 
Any orderly system that is complete in itself. 

 (1) The universe, especially when it is viewed as orderly and systematic. (2)

• The astronomer, the biologist, and the philosopher all try in their own ways to make sense of the
cosmos. 

Cosmos  often  simply  means  “universe.”  But  the  word  is  generally  used  to  suggest  an  orderly  or
harmonious universe, as it was originally used by Pythagoras in the 6th century B.C. Thus, a religious
mystic may help put us in touch with the cosmos, and so may a physicist. The same is often true of the
adjective cosmic: Cosmic rays (really particles rather than rays) bombard us from outer space, but
cosmic questions come from human attempts to find order in the universe.

- [[cosmology]] 
astronomy that deals with the origin and structure of the universe. 

 (1) A theory that describes the nature of the universe. (2) A branch of

•  New  Age  teachers  propose  a  cosmology  quite  unlike  the  traditional  Jewish,  Christian,  or  Islamic
ways of viewing the universe. 

Most religions and cultures include some kind of cosmology to explain the nature of the universe. In
modern astronomy, the leading cosmology is still the Big Bang theory, which claims that the universe
began with a huge explosion that sent matter and energy spreading out in all directions. One reason
why  fans  watch  Star Trek  is  for  the  various  cosmologies  depicted  in  the  show,  including  different
conceptions of space, time, and the meaning of life.

- [[microcosm]] 
version of something much larger. 

  Something  (such  as  a  place  or  an  event)  that  is  seen  as  a  small

• The large hippie communes of the 1960s and '70s were microcosms of socialist systems, with most
of socialism's advantages and disadvantages. 

A  troubled  urban  school  can  look  like  a  microcosm  of  America's  educational  system.  A  company's
problems  may  be  so  typical  that  they  can  represent  an  entire  small  country's  economic  woes  “in
microcosm.” Microcosm,  and  especially  its  synonym  microcosmos,  are  also  sometimes  used  when
talking  about  the  microscopic  world.  The  documentary  film  Microcosmos  is  devoted  to  the
remarkable insect life in an ordinary meadow on a single summer's day.

- [[cosmopolitan]] 
Made up of persons, elements, or influences from many different parts of the world. 

  (1)  Having  international  sophistication  and  experience.  (2)

•  New  York,  like  most  cosmopolitan  cities,  offers  a  wonderful  array  of  restaurants  featuring  foods
from around the world. 

Since  cosmopolitan  includes  the  root  polit-,  from  the  Greek  word  for  “citizen”,  someone  who  is
cosmopolitan  is  a  “citizen  of  the  world.”  She  may  be  able  to  read  the  morning  paper  in  Rio  de
Janeiro,  attend  a  lecture  in  Madrid,  and  assist  at  a  refugee  camp  in  Uganda  with  equal  ease—and
maybe all in the same week. And a city or a country that is cosmopolitan has aspects and elements
that come from various countries.

- SCI comes from the Latin verb scire, “to know” or “to understand.” The root appears in such common
