- SCI comes from the Latin verb scire, “to know” or “to understand.” The root appears in such common
words  as  science,  which  originally  meant  simply  “knowledge,”  and  conscience,  meaning  “moral
knowledge.” And to be conscious is to be in a state where you are able to know or understand.

- [[conscientious]] 
painstaking or exact attention. 

  (1)  Governed  by  morality;  scrupulous.  (2)  Resulting  from

• New employees should be especially conscientious about turning in all their assignments on time. 

Conscience and its adjective conscientious  both  come  from  a  Latin  verb  meaning  “to  be  aware  of
guilt.”  Conscientious  indicates  extreme  care,  either  in  observing  moral  laws  or  in  performing
assigned duties. A conscientious person is someone with a strong moral sense, who has feelings of
guilt when he or she violates it. A conscientious worker has a sense of duty that forces him or her to
do  a  careful  job.  A  conscientious  report  shows  painstaking  work  on  the  part  of  the  writer.  And  a
conscientious objector is someone who, for reasons of conscience, refuses to fight in an army.

- [[nescience]] 

 Lack of knowledge or awareness: ignorance. 

•  About  once  every  class  period,  my  political-science  professor  would  angrily  denounce  the
nescience of the American public. 

This word, which means literally “non-knowledge,” is only used by intellectuals, and the same is true
of its adjective, nescient. We all have heard the remarkable facts: 40% of us believe that humans and
dinosaurs lived on earth at the same time; 49% believe that the President can ignore the Constitution;
60% can't name the three branches of government; 75% can't find Israel on a map; and so on. Is it any
wonder we Americans are sometimes called nescient?

- [[prescient]] 

 Having or showing advance knowledge of what is going to happen. 

• For years she had read the Wall Street Journal every morning, looking for prescient warnings about
crashes, crises, and catastrophes on the horizon. 

Being truly prescient would require supernatural powers. But well-informed people may have such
good judgment as to appear prescient, and prescient is often used to mean “having good foresight.”
Some newspaper columnists may seem prescient in their predictions, but we can't help suspecting that
any apparent prescience is usually the result of leaks from people with inside knowledge.

- [[unconscionable]] 
Shockingly excessive, unreasonable, or unfair. 

  (1)  Not  guided  by  any  moral  sense;  unscrupulous.  (2)

• When the facts about how the cigarette industry had lied about its practices for decades finally came
out, most Americans found the behavior unconscionable. 

Something  that  can't  be  done  in  good  conscience  is  unconscionable,  and  such  acts  can  range  from
betraying  a  confidence  to  mass  murder.  For  a  five-syllable  word,  unconscionable  is  actually  quite
common. This is partly because it isn't always used very seriously; so, for example, a critic is free to
call  a  fat  new  book  “an  unconscionable  waste  of  trees.”  In  law,  an  unconscionable  contract  is  one
that, even though it was signed by both parties, is so ridiculous that a judge will just throw it out.
