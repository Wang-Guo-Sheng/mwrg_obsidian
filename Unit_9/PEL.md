- PEL comes from the Latin verb pellere, meaning “to move or drive.” So a propeller moves a small
airplane forward. And if you dispel someone's fears, you “drive them away.”

- [[compel]] 

 (1) To force (someone) to do something. (2) To make (something) happen. 

•  After  returning  from  the  lecture,  they  felt  compelled  to  contribute  to  one  of  the  refugee  relief
agencies. 

The prefix com- [[acts]] as a strengthener in this word; thus, to compel is to drive powerfully, or force.
So you may feel compelled to speak to a friend about his drinking, or compelled to reveal a secret in
order  to  prevent  something  from  happening.  A  compulsion  is  usually  a  powerful  inner  urge;  a
compulsive shopper or a compulsive gambler usually can't hold onto money for long. You might not
want to do something unless there's a compelling reason; however, a compelling film is simply one
that seems serious and important.

- [[expel]] 

 (1) To drive or force out. (2) To force to leave, usually by official action. 

• For repeatedly ignoring important agreements over several years, the two countries were eventually
expelled from the trade organization. 

To expel is to drive out, and its usual noun is expulsion. Expel is similar to eject, but expel suggests
pushing  out  while  eject  suggests  throwing  out.  Also,  ejecting  may  only  be  temporary:  the  player
ejected  from  a  game  may  be  back  tomorrow,  but  the  student  expelled  from  school  is  probably  out
forever.

- [[impel]] 

 To urge or drive forward by strong moral force. 

• As the meeting wore on without any real progress being made, she felt impelled to stand and speak. 

Impel is very similar in meaning to compel, and often a perfect synonym, though it tends to suggest
even more strongly an inner drive to do something and a greater urgency to act, especially for moral
reasons. But when impel takes its noun and adjective forms, it changes slightly. So an impulse—such
as “impulse buying,” when you suddenly see something cool and know you've got to have it—often
isn't  based  on  anything  very  serious.  And  impulsive  behavior  in  general,  such  as  blurting  out
something stupid on the spur of the moment, is the kind of thing you're supposed to get over when you
grow up.

- [[repel]] 

 (1) To keep (something) out or away. (2) To drive back. 

•  Her  son,  knowing  how  she  was  repelled  by  rats  and  snakes,  had  started  keeping  them  in  his
bedroom. 

Since re- [[can]] mean not just “again” but also “back” (see RE-), repel means “drive back.” Repel has
two common adjective forms; thus, a repellent or repulsive odor may drive us into the other room. Its
main noun form is repulsion. Magnets exhibit both attraction and repulsion, and the goal of an armed
defense  is  the  repulsion  of  an  enemy;  but  we  generally  use  repulsion  to  mean  “strong  dislike.”  In
recent years, repulse has been increasingly used as a synonym for repel (“That guy repulses me”).

- Words from Mythology

arachnid 
four pairs of legs and no antennae, such as spiders, scorpions, mites, and ticks. 

  A  member  of  the  class  Arachnida,  which  principally  includes  animals  with

• His interest in arachnids began when, as a child, he would watch spiders build their gorgeous webs
in the corners of the porch. 

The Greek word for “spider” is arachne, and, according to Greek mythology, the original arachnid
was a girl named Arachne. A marvelous weaver, she made the mistake of claiming she was better at
her craft than the goddess Athena. In a contest between the two, she angered the goddess by weaving a
remarkable tapestry showing the gods behaving badly. As punishment, Athena changed Arachne into a
spider, fated to spend her life weaving. With their eight legs, arachnids are easily distinguished from
the  six-legged  insects,  on  which  they  feed  by  injecting  digesting  juices  and  then  sucking  up  the
liquefied remains.

- [[calliope]] 
steam or compressed air. 

  A  musical  instrument  similar  to  an  organ  in  which  whistles  are  sounded  by

• The town's old calliope, with its unmistakable sound, summoned them to the fair every summer. 

To the ancient Greeks, the Muses were nine goddesses, each of whom was the spirit of one or more of
the arts and sciences. Calliope was the Muse of heroic or epic poetry, who inspired poets to write
such epics as the Iliad and the Odyssey. Since the lengthy epics were generally sung from beginning
to end, she was responsible for a great deal of musical reciting. But she wouldn't necessarily have
approved of having her name used for the hooting organlike instrument that was invented in America
around  1855.  Calliopes  gave  a  festive  air  to  the  great  showboats  that  floated  up  and  down  the
Mississippi and Ohio Rivers giving theatrical performances; the loudest could supposedly be heard
eight  miles  away,  attracting  customers  from  all  around.  Today  they  are  mostly  heard  on  merry-go-
rounds and at circuses.

- [[dryad]] 

 A wood nymph. 

• The ancient Greeks' love of trees can be seen in their belief that every tree contained a dryad, which
died when the tree was cut. 

The term dryad comes from the Greek word for “oak tree.” As the Greeks saw it, every tree (not only
oaks) had a spirit. The best known of the dryads was Daphne. The beautiful daughter of a river god,
she was desired by the god Apollo; as he was about to capture her, she prayed to her father to save
her, and he transformed her into a laurel tree. In her honor, Apollo commanded that the poet who won
the  highest  prize  every  year  be  crowned  with  a  laurel  wreath.  The  Greeks'  respect  for  trees
unfortunately failed to keep Greece's forests from shrinking greatly over the centuries, and those that
remain produce little wood of good quality.

- [[fauna]] 

 Animal life, especially the animals that live naturally in a given area or environment. 

•  The  larger  fauna  of  the  county  include  coyotes,  black  bear,  deer,  moose,  wild  turkey,  hawks,  and
vultures. 

Faunus and Fauna were the Roman woodland god and goddess for whom animals were a particular
concern. Faunus was the Roman equivalent of the Greek god Pan, and like Pan, he had goats' legs.
Their  goat-legged  helpers,  called  fauns,  were  known  for  their  love  of  pleasure  and  mischief.  The
fauna  of  a  continent  are  often  very  similar  across  a  broad  east-west  band;  from  north  to  south,
however, they may vary greatly.

- [[flora]] 
environment. 

  Plant  life,  especially  the  flowering  plants  that  live  naturally  in  a  specific  area  or

• Scientists are busily identifying the flora of the Amazon rain forest before the rapid expansion of
commercial interests consumes it. 

Flora  means  “flower”  in  Latin,  and  Flora  was  the  Roman  goddess  of  spring  and  flowering  plants,
especially wildflowers and plants not raised for food. She was shown as a beautiful young woman in
a long, flowing dress with flowers in her hair, strewing flowers over the earth. English preserves her
name  in  such  words  as  floral, floret, and flourish.  A  region's  flora  may  range  from  tiny  violets  to
towering trees. The common phrase “flora and fauna” covers just about every visible living thing.

- [[herculean]] 

 (1) Extremely strong. (2) Extremely extensive, intense, or difficult. 

• Accomplishing all the things he promised during the presidential campaign will be a herculean task. 

The hero Hercules, son of the god Zeus by a human mother, was famous for his superhuman strength.
To pacify the wrath of the god Apollo, he was forced to perform twelve enormously difficult tasks, or
“labors.”  These  ranged  from  descending  into  the  underworld  to  bring  back  the  terrifying  dog  that
guarded its entrance to destroying the many-headed monster called the Hydra. Any job or task that's
extremely difficult or calls for enormous strength is therefore called herculean.

- Pandora's box 

 A source of many troubles. 

•  In  a  thundering  speech,  he  predicted  that,  if  the  bill  was  passed,  the  new  policy  would  open  a
Pandora's box of economic problems. 

The god Prometheus stole fire from heaven to give to the human race, which originally consisted only
of men. To punish humanity, the other gods created the first woman, the beautiful Pandora. As a gift,
Zeus gave her a box, which she was told never to open. However, as soon as he was out of sight she
took off the lid, and out swarmed all the troubles of the world, never to be recaptured. Only Hope
was left in the box, stuck under the lid. Anything that looks ordinary but may produce unpredictable
harmful results can thus be called a Pandora's box.

- Scylla and Charybdis 

 Two equally dangerous alternatives. 

• Doctors and patients who need to calculate the ideal dosage of the medication, knowing how it can
trigger a different dangerous condition, often feel caught between Scylla and Charybdis. 

The  Strait  of  Messina  is  the  narrow  passage  between  the  island  of  Sicily  and  the  “toe”  of  Italy's
“boot.”  In  Greek  mythology,  two  monsters  hovered  on  either  side  of  the  strait.  Scylla,  a  female
monster with six snake-like heads, each with pointed teeth, barked like a dog from the rocks on the
Italian side. Charybdis, on the Sicilian side, caused a whirlpool by swallowing the waters of the sea
three times a day. When Odysseus attempted to sail between them, he encountered disaster on both
sides.  Being  caught  between  Scylla  and  Charybdis  is  a  lot  like  being  between  a  rock  and  a  hard
place.
