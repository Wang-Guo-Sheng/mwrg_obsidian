- PART,  from  the  Latin  word  pars,  meaning  “part,”  comes  into  English  most  obviously  in  our  word
part. An apartment or compartment is part of a larger whole. The same is usually true of a particle.

- [[bipartite]] 

 (1) Being in two parts. (2) Shared by two. 

• The report is a bipartite document, and all the important findings are in the second section. 

Usually  a  technical  word,  bipartite  is  common  in  medicine  and  biology.  A  bipartite  patella,  for
example,  is  a  split  kneecap;  many  people  are  born  with  them.  Many  creatures  have  a  bipartite  life
cycle, living life in two very distinct forms. As one example, the velella begins life as a creature that
travels with thousands of others in the form of a kind of sailboat, blown across the ocean's surface
with the wind; only later does each velella turn into a tiny jellyfish.

- [[impartial]] 

 Fair and not biased; treating or affecting all equally. 

• Representatives of labor and management agreed to have the matter decided by an impartial third
party. 

To be “partial to” or “partial toward” someone or something is to be somewhat biased or prejudiced,
which means that a person who is partial really only sees part of the whole picture. To be impartial is
the opposite. The United Nations sends impartial observers to monitor elections in troubled countries.
We hope judges and juries will be impartial when they hand down verdicts. But grandparents aren't
expected to be impartial when describing their new grandchild.

- [[participle]] 

 A word that is formed from a verb but used like an adjective. 

•  In  the  phrase  “the  crying  child,”“crying”  is  a  present  participle;  in  “satisfaction  guaranteed,”
“guaranteed” is a past participle. 

English verbs can take several basic forms, which we call their principal parts: the infinitive (“to
move,” “to speak,” etc.), the past tense (“moved,” “spoke”), the past participle (“moved,” “spoken”),
and the present participle (“moving,” “speaking”). The participles are words that “take part” in two
different  word  classes:  that  is,  verb  forms  that  can  also  act  like  adjectives  (“the  spoken  word,”  “a
moving  experience”).  A  grammatical  error  called  a  dangling  participle  occurs  when  a  sentence
begins with a participle that doesn't modify the subject; in the sentence “Climbing the mountain, the
cabin came in view,” for example, “climbing” is a dangling participle since it doesn't modify “cabin.”

- [[partisan]] 
guerrilla fighter. 

 (1) A person who is strongly devoted to a particular cause or group. (2) A

• Throughout his career on the Supreme Court, he had been a forthright partisan of the cause of free
speech. 

A  partisan  is  someone  who  supports  one  part  or  party.  Sometimes  the  support  takes  the  form  of
military action, as when guerrilla fighters take on government forces. But partisan is actually most
often  used  as  an  adjective,  usually  referring  to  support  of  a  political  party.  so  if  you're  accused  of
being  too  partisan,  or  of  practicing  partisan  politics,  it  means  you're  mainly  interested  in  boosting
your own party and attacking the other one.
