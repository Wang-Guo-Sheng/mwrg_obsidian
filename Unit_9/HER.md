HER comes from the Latin verb haerere, meaning “to stick.” Another form of the verb produces the
root  hes-,  seen  in  such  words  as  adhesive,  which  means  basically  “sticky”  or  “sticking,”  and
hesitate, which means more or less “stuck in one place.”

- [[adherent]] 
believes in a particular philosophy or religion. 

  (1)  Someone  who  follows  a  leader,  a  party,  or  a  profession.  (2)  One  who

•  The  general's  adherents  heavily  outnumbered  his  opponents  and  managed  to  shout  them  down
repeatedly. 

Just as tape adheres to paper, a person may adhere to a cause, a faith, or a belief. Thus, you may be an
adherent  of  Hinduism,  an  adherent  of  environmentalism,  or  an  adherent  of  the  Republican  Party.  A
plan for cutting taxes always attracts adherents easily, regardless of what the cuts may result in.

- [[cohere]] 

 To hold together firmly as parts of the same mass. 

• His novels never really cohere; the chapters always seem like separate short stories. 

When you finish writing a paper, you may feel that it coheres well, since it's sharply focused and all
the ideas seem to support each other. When all the soldiers in an army platoon feel like buddies, the
platoon has become a cohesive unit. In science class you may learn the difference between cohesion
(the tendency of a chemical's molecules to stick together) and adhesion (the tendency of the molecules
of two different substances to stick together). Water molecules tend to cohere, so water falls from the
sky  in  drops,  not  as  separate  molecules.  But  water  molecules  also  adhere  to  molecules  of  other
substances, so raindrops will often cling to the underside of a clothesline for a while before gravity
pulls them down.

- [[incoherent]] 
inconsistent. 

  (1)  Unclear  or  difficult  to  understand.  (2)  Loosely  organized  or

• The police had found him in an abandoned warehouse, and they reported that he was dirty, hungry,
and incoherent. 

Incoherent  is  the  opposite  of  coherent,  and  both  commonly  refer  to  words  and  thoughts.  Just  as
coherent  means  well  ordered  and  clear,  incoherent  means  disordered  and  hard  to  follow.
Incoherence in speech may result from emotional stress, especially anxiety or anger. Incoherence in
writing  may  simply  result  from  poor  planning;  a  twelve-page  term  paper  that  isn't  written  until  the
night before it's due will generally suffer from incoherence.

- [[inherent]] 

 Part of something by nature or habit. 

• A guiding belief behind our Constitution is that individuals have certain inherent rights that can't be
taken away. 

Inherent  literally  refers  to  something  that  is  “stuck  in”  something  else  so  firmly  that  they  can't  be
separated.  A  plan  may  have  an  inherent  flaw  that  will  cause  it  to  fail;  a  person  may  have  inherent
virtues that everyone admires. Since the flaw and the virtues can't be removed, the plan may simply
have to be thrown out and the person will remain virtuous forever.

- FUG comes from the Latin verb fugere, meaning “to flee or escape.” Thus, a refugee flees from some
