• In her only psychedelic experience, back in 1970, she had watched with horror as the walls began crawling with bizarrely colored creatures. 

The most famous—or notorious—of the psychedelic drugs is *LSD*, a compound that can be obtained
from  various  *mushrooms*  and  other  fungi  but  is  usually  created  in  the  lab.  The  other  well-known psychedelics  are  *psilocybin*  (likewise  obtained  from  fungi)  and  *mescaline*  (obtained  from  peyote
cactus).  How  psychedelics  produce  their  effects  is  still  fairly  mysterious,  partly  because  research ceased  for  almost  20  years  because  of  their reputation,  but  scientists  are  determined  to  find  the answers and much research is now under way. Psychedelics are now used to treat anxiety in patients with  cancer,  and  are  being  tested  in  the  treatment  of  such  serious conditions  as  severe  depression, alcoholism, and drug addiction.
