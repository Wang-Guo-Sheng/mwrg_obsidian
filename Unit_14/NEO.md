- NOV comes from the Latin word novus, meaning “new.” To renovate an old house is to “make it new
again”—that  is,  put  it  back  in  tip-top  shape.  The  long-running  PBS  show  Nova  keeps  its  large
audience up to date on what's new in the world of science. And when the British king sent Scottish
settlers to a large island off Canada's Atlantic coast in the 17th century, he named it Nova Scotia, or
“New Scotland.”

- [[novice]] 
beginner. (2) A new member of a religious order who is preparing to become a nun or monk. 

 (1) One who has no previous training or experience in a specific field or activity;

• It's hard to believe that a year ago she was a complete novice as a gardener, who couldn't identify a
cornstalk. 

Among the ancient Romans, a novice (novicius) was usually a newly imported slave, who had to be
trained in his or her duties. Among Catholics and Buddhists, if you desire to become a priest, monk,
or nun, you must serve as a novice for a period of time, often a year (called your novitiate), before
being ordained or fully professing your vows. No matter what kind of novice you are—at computers,
at writing, at politics, etc.—you've got a lot to learn.

- [[novel]] 
striking, especially in conception or style. 

  (1)  New  and  not  resembling  something  formerly  known  or  used.  (2)  Original  and

•  His  techniques  for  dealing  with  these  disturbed  young  people  were  novel,  and  they  caught  the
attention of the institute's director. 

If someone tells you that you've come up with a novel idea or a novel interpretation of something, it's
probably  a  compliment:  not  everyone  is  capable  of  original  thinking.  But  not  everything  new  is
terribly worthwhile; a novelty, for example, is often a cute (or maybe just silly) little object that you
might  put  on  a  display  shelf  in  your  house.  It  may  seem  surprising  that  the  familiar  noun  novel  is
related as well. In the 14th century, Italian writers began writing collections of short tales, each of
which  they  called  a  novella  because  it  represented  a  new  literary  form;  from  this  word,  three
centuries later, the English coined the noun novel.

- [[innovation]] 
devices, or methods. 

 (1) A new idea, device, or method. (2) The introduction of new ideas,

•  “Smooshing”  bits  of  candy  into  ice  cream  while  the  customer  watched  was  just  one  of  his
innovations that later got copied by chains of ice-cream outlets. 

Innovation is a word that's almost always connected with business. In business today, it's almost a
rule that a company that doesn't innovate is destined for failure. The most important and successful
businesses were usually started by innovators. And company managers should always at least listen
to the innovative ideas of their employees.

- [[supernova]] 
(2) Something that explodes into prominence or popularity. 

 (1) The explosion of a star that causes it to become extremely bright.

•  After  exploding,  a  nova  leaves  a  “white  dwarf”  which  may  explode  again  in  the  future,  but  a
supernova destroys the entire star. 

A  nova,  despite  its  name,  isn't  actually  a  “new”  star,  but  rather  one  that  wasn't  noticed  until  it
exploded, when it may increase in brightness by a million times before returning to its previous state
a few days later. A supernova is far larger; a star in its supernova state may emit a billion times as
much light as previously. After a few weeks it begins to dim, until it eventually ceases to exist; it's
often replaced by a black hole. (Though remains that were shot out into space may survive; those of a
great  supernova  seen  in  A.D.  1054  are  now  known  as  the  Crab  Nebula.)  All  this  may  serve  as  a
warning  to  those  human  stars  whose  fame  explodes  too  rapidly;  supernovas  of  this  kind  have
sometimes vanished by the following year.
