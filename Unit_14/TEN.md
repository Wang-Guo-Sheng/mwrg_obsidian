MONO comes from the Greek monos, meaning “along” or “single.” So a monorail is a railroad that
has only one rail; a monocle is an old-fashioned eyeglass that a gentleman used to squeeze into his
eye socket; a monotonous voice seems to have only one tone; and a monopoly puts all ownership of a
type of product or service in the hands of a single company.

- [[monogamous]] 

 Being married to one person or having one mate at a time. 

• Geese, swans, and most other birds are monogamous and mate for life. 

American marriage is by law monogamous; people are permitted to have only one spouse (husband or
wife) at a time. There are cultures with laws that permit marriage to more than one person at a time,
or polygamy. Some Islamic countries permit polygamy, as do some African tribes. In this country the
Mormons  were  polygamous  until  1890,  when  they  were  forced  to  adopt  monogamy  by  the
unsympathetic federal government.

- [[monoculture]] 
of land. (2) A culture dominated by a single element. 

 (1) The cultivation of a single crop to the exclusion of other uses

• Monoculture is practiced on a vast scale in the American Midwest, where nothing but corn can be
seen in the fields for hundreds of square miles. 

The Irish Potato Famine of 1845-49, which led to the deaths of over a million people, resulted from
the monoculture of potatoes, which were destroyed by a terrible blight, leaving farmers nothing else
to eat. Almost every traditional farming society has practiced crop rotation, the planting of different
crops on a given piece of land from year to year, so as to keep the soil from losing its quality. But in
the modern world, monoculture has become the rule on the largest commercial farms, where the same
crop can be planted year after year by means of the intensive use of fertilizers. Modern monoculture
has  produced  huge  crops;  on  a  large  scale,  it  permits  great  efficiency  in  planting,  pest  control,  and
harvesting. But many experts believe this all comes at a huge cost to the environment.

- [[monolithic]] 
of material with no joints or seams. 

 (1) Appearing to be a huge, featureless, often rigid whole. (2) Made up

• The sheer monolithic rock face of Yosemite's El Capitan looks impossible to climb, but its cracks
and seams are enough for experienced rock climbers. 

The -lith in monolith comes from the Greek lithos, “stone,” so monolith in its original sense means a
huge  stone  like  those  at  Stonehenge.  What's  so  impressive  about  monoliths  is  that  they  have  no
separate parts or pieces. To the lone individual, any huge institution or government bureaucracy can
seem  monolithic.  But  the  truth  may  be  different:  The  former  U.S.S.R.  once  seemed  monolithic  and
indestructible to the West, but in the 1990s it crumbled into a number of independent republics.

- [[monotheism]] 

 The worship of a single god. 

•  Christian  monotheism  finally  triumphed  in  the  Roman  Empire  in  A.D.  392,  when  the  worship  of
pagan gods and goddesses was forbidden. 

The monotheism of the ancient Hebrews had to combat the polytheism (worship of many gods) of the
surrounding  peoples  from  the  earliest  times.  As  the  Bible  relates,  several  times  in  their  history  the
Hebrews  turned  away  from  their  monotheistic  beliefs  and  accepted  foreign  gods,  such  as  those
imported by King Solomon. Each time their own God would punish them for their disloyalty, and the
people of Israel would return to monotheism. Today Judaism shares its monotheism with two much
larger religions, Christianity and Islam.

- UNI comes from the Latin word for “one.” A uniform is a single design worn by everyone. A united
