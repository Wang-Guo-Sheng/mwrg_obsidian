- TROP comes from the Greek tropos, meaning “turn” or “change.” The troposphere is the level of the
atmosphere  where  most  weather  changes—or  “turns  in  the  weather”—occur.  And  the  Tropics  of
Cancer and Capricorn are the lines of latitude where the sun is directly overhead when it reaches its
northernmost  and  southernmost  points,  on  about  June  22  and  December  22  every  year—that  is,  the
point where it seems to turn and go back the other way.

- [[tropism]] 
place, especially a plant, that involves turning or growing toward or away from a stimulus. 

  Automatic  movement  by  an  organism  unable  to  move  about  from  place  to

• The new president was soon showing a tropism for bold action, a tendency that seemed more the
result of instinct than of careful thought. 

In hydrotropism, a plant's roots grow in the direction of increasing moisture, hoping to obtain water.
In phototropism,  a  plant  (or  fungus)  moves  toward  light,  usually  the  sun—perhaps  because,  in  the
colder climates where such plants are usually found, concentrating the sun's warmth within the sun-
seeking  flower  can  create  a  warm  and  inviting  environment  for  the  insects  that  fertilize  it.  In
thigmotropism, the organism moves in response to being touched; most climbing plants, for example,
put out tiny tendrils that feel around for something solid and then attach themselves or curl around it.
When microbiologists talk about tropism, however, they're often referring instead to the way a virus
will  seek  out  a  particular  type  of  cell  to  infect.  And  when  intellectuals  use  the  word,  they  usually
mean a tendency shown by a person or group which they themselves might not even be aware of.

- [[entropy]] 
state of inactive uniformity. (2) Chaos, randomness. 

 (1) The decomposition of the matter and energy in the universe to an ultimate

•  The  apartment  had  been  reduced  to  an  advanced  state  of  entropy,  as  if  a  tiny  tornado  had  torn
through it, shattering its contents and mixing the pieces together in a crazy soup. 

With  its  Greek  prefix  en-,  meaning  “within,”  and  the  trop-  root  here  meaning  “change,”  entropy
basically  means  “change  within  (a  closed  system).”  The  closed  system  we  usually  think  of  when
speaking of entropy (especially if we're not physicists) is the entire universe. But entropy applies to
closed systems of any size. Entropy is seen when the ice in a glass of water in a warm room melts—
that is, as the temperature of everything in the room evens out. In a slightly different type of entropy, a
drop of food coloring in that glass of water soon spreads out evenly. However, when a nonphysicist
uses the word, he or she is usually trying to describe a large-scale collapse.

- [[heliotrope]] 

 Any of a genus of herbs or shrubs having small white or purple flowers. 

• A long bank of purple heliotrope lined the walkway, and her guests were always remarking on the
flowers' glorious fragrance. 

Helios  was  the  god  of  the  sun  in  Greek  mythology,  and  helio-  came  to  appear  in  a  number  of  sun-
related English words. The genus known as the heliotropes consists of about 250 species; many are
thought  of  as  weeds,  but  the  best-known  species,  garden  heliotrope,  is  a  popular  and  fragrant
perennial  that  resembles  the  forget-me-not.  The  heliotrope  tends  to  follow  the  sun—that  is,  turn  its
blossoms  toward  the  sun  as  it  travels  from  East  to  West  every  day.  But  the  fact  is,  heliotropism—
turning toward the sun—is common among flowers (and even leaves), and some, like the sunflower,
are more dramatically heliotropic than the heliotrope. Those in the far North actually use their petals
to reflect the sun's heat onto the flower's central ovary during the short growing season.

- [[psychotropic]] 

 Acting on the mind. 

• My mother is taking two drugs that may produce psychotropic side effects, and I'm worried that they
might be interacting. 

Psychotropic  is  used  almost  always  to  describe  substances  that  we  consume.  Such  substances  are
more  numerous  than  you  might  think,  and  some  have  been  known  for  thousands  of  years.  Native
American  religions,  for  example,  have  used  psychotropic  substances  derived  from  certain  cactuses
and  mushrooms  for  centuries.  Caffeine  and  nicotine  can  be  called  psychotropic.  Psychotropic
prescription drugs include antidepressants (such as Prozac) and tranquilizers (such as Valium). Any
medication that blocks pain, from aspirin to the anesthetics used during surgery, can be considered a
psychotropic  drug.  Even  children  are  now  prescribed  psychotropic  drugs,  often  to  treat  attention
deficit disorder. And all recreational drugs are psychotropic. Psychoactive is a common synonym of
psychotropic.
