- POS comes from the Latin verb ponere, meaning “to put” or “to place.” You expose film by “placing
it  out”  in  the  light.  You  compose  a  song  by  “putting  together”  a  series  of  notes.  And  you  oppose
locating a new prison in your town by “putting yourself against” it.

- [[impose]] 
To take unfair advantage. 

 (1) To establish or apply as a charge or penalty or in a forceful or harmful way. (2)

• After seeing her latest grades, her parents imposed new rules about how much time she had to spend
on homework every night. 

The Latin imposui meant “put upon,” and that meaning carried over into English in impose. A CEO
may impose a new manager on one of the company's plants. A state may impose new taxes on luxury
items  or  cigarettes,  and  the  federal  government  sometimes  imposes  trade  restrictions  on  another
country  to  punish  it.  A  polite  apology  might  begin  with  “I  hope  I'm  not  imposing  on  you”  (that  is,
“forcing my presence on you”). And a self-imposed deadline is one that you decide to hold yourself
to.

- [[juxtapose]] 

 To place side by side. 

• You won't notice the difference between the original and the copy unless you juxtapose them. 

Since  juxta  means  “near”  in  Latin,  it's  easy  to  see  how  juxtapose  was  formed.  Juxtaposing  is
generally  done  for  examination  or  effect.  Interior  designers  constantly  make  decisions  about
juxtaposing objects and colors for the best effect. Juxtaposing two video clips showing the different
things that a politician said about the same subject at two different times can be an effective means of
criticizing. The juxtaposition  of  two  similar  X-rays  can  help  medical  students  distinguish  between
two conditions that may be hard to tell apart. And advertisements frequently juxtapose “before” and
“after” images to show a thrilling transformation.

- [[transpose]] 
place or period to another. 

 (1) To change the position or order of (two things). (2) To move from one

• She rechecked the phone number and discovered that two digits had been transposed. 

Though  transposing  two  digits  can  be  disastrous,  transposing  two  letters  in  a  word  often  doesn't
matter too much. (You can prboalby raed tihs setnence witohut too mcuh toruble.) Transposing two
words or sounds—as in “Can I sew you to another sheet?”—has been a good source of humor over
the years. Doctors sometimes discover that something in the body—a nerve, an organ, etc.—has been
transposed, or moved away from its proper place. For musicians, transposing means changing the key
of a piece; if you can do this at a moment's notice, you've been well trained.

- [[superimpose]] 

 To put or place one thing over something else. 

• Using transparent sheets, she superimposes territory boundaries on an outline of Africa, showing us
how these changed in the late 19th and early 20th century. 

Superimposition was one of the magical effects employed by early filmmakers. Using “mirror shots,”
with semitransparent mirrors set at 45° angles to the scene, they would superimpose shadowy images
of  ghosts  or  scenes  from  a  character's  past  onto  scenes  from  the  present.  Superimposing  your  own
ideas on something, such as a historical event, has to be done carefully, since your ideas may change
whenever you learn something new about the event.

- TEN, from the Latin verb tenere, basically means “hold” or “hold on to.” A tenant is the “holder” of
