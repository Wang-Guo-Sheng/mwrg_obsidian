CRYPT comes from the Greek word for “hidden.” To encrypt a message is to encode it—that is, to
hide its meaning in code language. When a scientific term begins with crypto-, it always means that
there's something hidden about it .

church. (2) A room or area in a large aboveground tomb. 

  (1)  A  room  completely  or  partly  underground,  especially  under  the  main  floor  of  a

• His old nightmare was of being locked in a crypt with corpses as his only companions. 

Hidden  under  the  main  floor  of  a  great  church  is  often  a  large  room,  often  with  a  tomb  as  its
centerpiece.  Many  major  European  churches  were  built  over  the  remains  of  a  saint—the  Vatican's
great St. Peter's Basilica is an example—and instead of having the coffin buried, it was often given its
spacious  room  below  ground  level.  In  a  large  aboveground  tomb,  or  mausoleum,  there  may  be
several small chambers for individual coffins, also called crypts; when the comic book Tales from
the Crypt made its first appearance in 1950, it was this meaning that the authors were referring to.

- [[encrypt]] 

 (1) To convert into cipher. (2) To convert a message into code. 

• Messages on the group's Web site are encrypted in code words to keep law-enforcement agents from
understanding them. 

Codes aren't always in another language; people have always been able to communicate in ways that
conceal their real meaning. In countries ruled by dictators, novelists and playwrights have sometimes
managed to encrypt their messages, conveying political ideas to their audiences so that the authorities
never  notice.  But  encryption  today  usually  refers  to  a  complex  procedure  performed  on  electronic
text  to  make  sure  the  wrong  people—whether  a  nation's  enemies  or  a  business  competitor  (most
businesses  use  encryption  today)—can't  read  it.  And  sensitive  data  that  merely  resides  on  a
company's own computers is often encrypted as well.

- [[cryptic]] 

 (1) Mysterious; puzzlingly short. (2) Acting to hide or conceal. 

• From across the room, Louisa threw Philip a cryptic look, and he puzzled over what she was trying
to tell him. 

Until the writing on the famous Rosetta Stone was finally translated in the early 19th century, Egyptian
hieroglyphic  writing  was  entirely  cryptic,  its  meaning  hidden  from  the  modern  world.  In  the  same
way,  a  cryptic  comment  is  one  whose  meaning  is  unclear,  and  a  cryptic  note  may  leave  you
wondering. Cryptic coloring among plants and animals acts like camouflage; so, for example, some
moths that are tasty to blue jays are cryptically colored to look like bugs that jays won't touch.

- [[cryptography]] 

 (1) Secret writing. (2) The encoding and decoding of messages. 

• As a graduate student in mathematics, she never dreamed she would end up working in cryptography
for the Defense Department. 

During  World  War  II,  cryptography  became  an  extremely  complex  science  for  both  the  Allied  and
Axis powers. The Allies managed to secretly crack the code produced by the Nazis' Enigma machine,
and thereby may have shortened the war by two years. The Axis cryptographers, on the other hand,
never managed to crack the Americans' ultimate code—the spoken languages of the Navajo and other
American Indians. In the age of computers, cryptography has become almost unbelievably complex;
it's widely used in peacetime in such areas as banking telecommunications.
