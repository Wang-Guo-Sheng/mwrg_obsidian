- AB/ABS comes to us from Latin, and means “from,” “away,” or “off.” Abuse is the use of something
in the wrong way. To abduct is to “lead away from” or kidnap. Aberrant behavior is behavior that
“wanders away from” what is acceptable. But there are so many words that include these roots that it
would be absurd to try to list them all here.

- [[abscond]] 

 To depart in secret and hide. 

• They discovered the next morning that their guest had absconded with most of the silverware during
the night. 

Wagner's  massive  four-part  opera  The  Ring  of  the  Nibelung  begins  with  a  dwarf  absconding  with
gold which he turns into a magic ring. And in J. R. R. Tolkien's The Hobbit, Bilbo Baggins absconds
from Gollum's caves with the ring he has found, the ring Gollum calls “my precious”; what follows is
detailed in the three-volume Lord of the Rings. (Tolkien knew Wagner's opera well.) A young couple
might  abscond  from  their  parents  to  get  married,  but  sooner  or  later  they  must  face  those  parents
again.

- [[abstemious]] 

 Restrained, especially in the consumption of food or alcohol. 

• Her parents had left her two million dollars when they died, having been so abstemious for years
that their neighbors all assumed they were poor. 

Many  14th-century  monks  lived  by  the  Rule  of  St.  Benedict,  which  demands  an  abstemious  life  of
obedience  and  poverty.  But  not  all  monks  could  maintain  such  abstemious  habits.  Chaucer's
Canterbury Tales contains a portrait of a fat monk who is supposed to follow a vegetarian diet but
instead is an enthusiastic hunter who loves a juicy swan best. He justifies breaking the Rule by saying
that it's old-fashioned and that he's just keeping up with modern times. Abstemious itself has a slightly
old-fashioned  sound  today,  especially  in  a  country  where  everyone  is  constantly  encouraged  to
consume.

- [[abstraction]] 
particular example. 

  The  consideration  of  a  thing  or  idea  without  associating  it  with  a

• All the ideas she came up with in class were abstractions, since she had no experience of actual
nursing at all. 

From its roots, abstraction should mean basically “something pulled or drawn away.” So abstract art
is  art  that  has  moved  away  from  painting  objects  of  the  ordinary  physical  world  in  order  to  show
something beyond it. Theories are often abstractions; so a theory about economics, for instance, may
“pull back” to take a broad view that somehow explains all of economics (but maybe doesn't end up
explaining  any  of  it  very  successfully).  An  abstract  of  a  medical  or  scientific  article  is  a  one-
paragraph summary of its contents—that is, the basic findings “pulled out” of the article.

- [[abstruse]] 

 Hard to understand; deep or complex. 

•  In  every  class  he  fills  the  blackboard  with  abstruse  calculations,  and  we  usually  leave  more
confused than ever. 

The original meaning of abstruse, coming almost straight from the Latin, was “concealed, hidden.”
It's easy to see how the word soon came to describe the kind of language used by those who possess
certain  kinds  of  expert  knowledge  (and  don't  necessarily  want  to  share  it  with  other  people).
Scientific writing is often filled with the kind of abstruse special vocabulary that's necessary for exact
and precise descriptions. Unfortunately, the language of a science like quantum physics can make an
already difficult subject even more abstruse to the average person.

Answers

- PED- [[comes]] from the Greek word for “child.” The same root also has the meaning “foot” (see PED),
but in English words it usually isn't hard to tell the two apart.

- [[pedagogy]] 

 The art, science, or profession of teaching. 

• His own pedagogy is extremely original; it sometimes alarms school officials but his students love
it. 

Since in Greek agogos means “leader,” a paidagogos was a slave who led boys to school and back,
but also taught them manners and tutored them after school. In time, pedagogue came to mean simply
“teacher”; today the word has an old-fashioned ring to it, so it often means a stuffy, boring teacher.
The word pedagogy, though, is still widely used, and often means simply “teaching.” And pedagogic
training is what everyone majoring in education receives.

- [[pedant]] 
learning. 

  (1)  A  formal,  unimaginative  teacher.  (2)  A  person  who  shows  off  his  or  her

• At one time or another, every student encounters a pedant who can make even the most interesting
subject tedious. 

It isn't always easy to tell a pedantic teacher from one who is simply thorough. Some professors get
an undeserved reputation for pedantry from students who just don't like the subject much. Regardless
of that, a pedant need not be a teacher; anyone who goes around displaying his or her knowledge in a
boring way can qualify.

- [[pediatrician]] 
of children. 

 A doctor who specializes in the diseases, development, and care

• Children in the U.S. usually see a pediatrician until they turn at least 15 or 16. 

Since  iatros  means  “physician”  in  Greek  (see  IATR),  words  such  as  pediatric  naturally  refer  to
“children's medicine.” Pediatrics is a fairly new medical specialty; until about 1900, children were
considered small adults and given the same medical treatment, only milder. Benjamin Spock was the
most  famous  pediatrician  of  the  20th  century,  and  his  book  Baby  and  Child  Care  changed  the  way
millions of Americans raised their children.

- [[encyclopedic]] 
of subjects. 

 (1) Of or relating to an encyclopedia. (2) Covering a wide range

• Someone with the kind of encyclopedic knowledge she has should be competing on Jeopardy. 

In  Greek,  paidaea  meant  not  simply  “child-rearing”  but  also  “education,”  and  kyklios  meant
“general”; thus, an encyclopedia is a work broad enough to provide a kind of general education. The
world's  most  eminent  general  encyclopedia,  the  Encyclopaedia  Britannica,  is  a  huge  work  that
covers every field of human knowledge. But encyclopedic doesn't have to refer to books; it's often
used to describe the wide-ranging knowledge that certain types of minds just can't stop acquiring.

- TROP comes from the Greek tropos, meaning “turn” or “change.” The troposphere is the level of the
