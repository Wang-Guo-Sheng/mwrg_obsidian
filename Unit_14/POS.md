- TEN, from the Latin verb tenere, basically means “hold” or “hold on to.” A tenant is the “holder” of
an  apartment,  house,  or  land,  but  not  necessarily  the  owner.  A  lieutenant  governor  may  “hold  the
position” ( “serve in lieu”) of the governor when necessary.

- [[tenure]] 
keep a job, especially the job of teacher or professor. 

 (1) The amount of time that a person holds a job, office, or title. (2) The right to

• I know two assistant professors who are so worried about being denied tenure this year that they
can't sleep. 

Tenure  is  about  holding  on  to  something,  almost  always  a  job  or  position.  So  you  can  speak  of
someone's  30-year  tenure  as  chairman,  or  someone's  brief  tenure  in  the  sales  manager's  office.  But
tenure  means  something  slightly  different  in  the  academic  world.  In  American  colleges  and
universities,  the  best  (or  luckiest)  teachers  have  traditionally  been  granted  a  lifetime  appointment
known as tenure after about six years of teaching. Almost nobody has as secure a job as a tenured
professor, but getting tenure can be difficult, and most of them have earned it.

- [[tenacious]] 

 Stubborn or determined in clinging to something. 

• He was known as a tenacious reporter who would stay with a story for months, risking his health
and sometimes even his life. 

Success  in  most  fields  requires  a  tenacious  spirit  and  a  drive  to  achieve.  Nowhere  is  this  more
apparent than in the entertainment business. Thousands of actors and actresses work tenaciously to
build a TV or film career. But without talent or beauty, tenacity is rarely rewarded, and only a few
become stars.

- [[tenable]] 

 Capable of being held or defended; reasonable. 

• She was depressed for weeks after her professor said that her theory wasn't tenable. 

Tenable means “holdable.” In the past it was often used in a physical sense—for example, to refer to
a city that an army was trying to “hold” militarily against an enemy force. But nowadays it's almost
always used when speaking of “held” ideas and theories. If you hold an opinion but evidence appears
that completely contradicts it, your opinion is no longer tenable. So, for example, the old ideas that
cancer is infectious or that being bled by leeches can cure your whooping cough now seem untenable.

- [[tenet]] 
group or profession. 

 A widely held principle or belief, especially one held in common by members of a

• It was soon obvious that the new owners didn't share the tenets that the company's founders had held
to all those years. 

A tenet is something we hold, but not with our hands. Tenets are often ideals, but also often statements
of faith. Thus, we may speak of the tenets of Islam or Hinduism, the tenets of Western democracy, or
the tenets of the scientific method, and in each case these tenets may combine elements of both faith
and ideals.
