- NEO comes from the Greek neos, meaning “new.” Neo- [[has]] become a part of many English words.
Some are easy to understand; for example, neo-Nazi.  Some  are  less  so;  you  might  not  immediately
guess  that  neotropical  means  “from  the  tropics  of  the  New  World,”  or  that  a  neophyte  is  a
“newcomer.” When William Ramsay discovered four new gases, he named them all using Greek roots
that  at  first  glance  might  sound  slightly  mysterious:  argon  (“idle”),  krypton  (“hidden”),  xenon
(“strange”)—and neon (“new”).

- [[neoclassic]] 
Roman, especially in music, art, or architecture. 

  Relating  to  a  revival  or  adaptation  of  the  styles  of  ancient  Greece  and

•  He  had  always  admired  the  paintings  of  the  French  neoclassical  masters,  especially  Poussin  and
Ingres. 

In the arts and architecture, a style that has existed for a long time usually produces a reaction against
it. So after the showy style of Europe's so-called baroque era (from about 1600 to the early 1700s),
the reaction came in the form of the neoclassical movement, bringing order, restraint, and simpler and
more  conservative  structures,  whether  in  plays,  sonatas,  sculptures,  or  public  buildings.  Its
inspiration was the art of ancient Greece and Rome—that is, of classical antiquity. Why classical? In
Latin classicus meant “of the highest class,” so in English classic and classical originally described
the  best  ancient  Greek  and  Latin  literature,  but  soon  came  to  mean  simply  “of  ancient  Greek  and
Rome,”  since  these  were  already  seen  as  the  highest  and  best  cultures.  Neoclassic  generally
describes artworks from the 1700s or early 1800s (by the painter David, the composer Mozart, the
sculptor Canova, etc.), but also works from the 20th century that seem to have been inspired by the
ideals of Greece and Rome.

- Neolithic 
tools were used. 

  Of  or  relating  to  the  latest  period  of  the  Stone  Age,  when  polished  stone

• Around the Mediterranean, the Neolithic period was a time of trade, of stock breeding, and of the
first use of pottery. 

Since lithos in Greek means “stone,” the Neolithic period is the “new” or “late” period of the Stone
Age, in contrast to the Paleolithic period (“old” or “early” period—see PALEO) and the Mesolithic
period (“middle” period) of the Stone Age. The use of polished stone tools came to different parts of
the world at different times, but the Neolithic Age is usually said to begin around 9000 B.C. and to
end  around  3000  B.C.,  when  the  Bronze  Age  begins.  The  Neolithic  is  the  era  when  the  farming  of
plants and animals begins, and when, as a result, humans first begin to create permanent settlements.

- [[neoconservative]] 
democracy and the U.S. national interest in world affairs, including through military means. 

  A  conservative  who  favors  strongly  encouraging

• Many believed that foreign policy in those years had fallen into the hands of the neoconservatives,
and that the war in Iraq was one result. 

In  the  1960s  several  well-known  socialist  intellectuals,  including  Norman  Podhoretz  and  Irving
Kristol,  alarmed  by  growing  political  extremism  on  the  left,  began  to  move  in  the  other  direction.
Soon the term neoconservative (or neocon for short) was being attached to them. Rather than simply
drifting toward the political center, Podhoretz and Kristol actually moved far to the right, especially
on the issue of maintaining a strong military stance toward the rest of the world. The main magazine
of neoconservatism became Podhoretz's Commentary;  it  was  later  joined  by  the  Weekly  Standard,
edited by Kristol's son William. Not everyone agrees on how to define these terms; still, it's clear that
today you don't have to be a former liberal in order to be a neoconservative.

- [[neonatal]] 

 Of or relating to babies in the first month after their birth. 

• The hospital's newest addition is a neonatal intensive-care unit, and newborns in critical condition
are already being sent there from considerable distances. 

Partly based on the Latin natus, “born,” neonatal means “newly born.” Neonatal babies themselves
are called neonates. Most hospitals now offer neonatal screening, which is used to detect diseases
that are treatable only if identified during the first days of life, and specialized neonatal nursing as
well. But despite spending much money on neonatal care, the U.S. still ranks lower than some much
less  wealthy  countries  (such  as  the  Czech  Republic,  Portugal,  and  Cuba)  in  infant  mortality  (infant
deaths).

- NOV comes from the Latin word novus, meaning “new.” To renovate an old house is to “make it new
