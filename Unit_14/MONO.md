- UNI comes from the Latin word for “one.” A uniform is a single design worn by everyone. A united
group has one single opinion, or forms a single unit. A unitard is a one-piece combination leotard
and tights, very good for skating, skiing, dancing—or riding a one-wheeled unicycle.

- [[unicameral]] 

 Having only one lawmaking chamber. 

• In China, with its unicameral system of government, a single group of legislators meets to make the
laws. 

Unicameral means “one-chambered,” and the term almost always describes a governing body. Our
federal legislature, like those of most democracies, is bicameral, with two legislative (lawmaking)
bodies—the  Senate  and  the  House  of  Representatives.  And  except  for  Nebraska,  all  the  state
legislatures are also bicameral. So why did the nation decide on a bicameral system? Partly in order
to keep some power out of the hands of ordinary voters, who the Founding Fathers didn't completely
trust.  For  that  reason,  the  original  Constitution  states  that  senators  are  to  be  elected  by  the  state
legislatures; not until 1914, after passage of a Constitutional amendment, did we first cast direct votes
for our senators.

- [[unilateral]] 
the body. 

 (1) Done by one person or party; one-sided. (2) Affecting one side of

• The Japanese Constitution of 1947 includes a unilateral rejection of warfare as an option for their
country. 

The world is a smaller place than it used to be, and we get uncomfortable when a single nation adopts
a  policy  of  unilateralism—that  is,  acting  independently  with  little  regard  for  what  the  rest  of  the
world  thinks.  A  unilateral  invasion  of  another  country,  for  instance,  usually  looks  like  a  grab  for
power  and  resources.  But  occasionally  the  world  welcomes  a  unilateral  action,  as  when  the  U.S.
announced unilateral nuclear-arms reductions in the early 1990s. Previously, such reductions had only
happened  as  part  of  bilateral  (“two-sided”)  agreements  with  the  old  Soviet  Union.  Multilateral
agreements, on issues such as climate change, often involve most of the world's nations.

- [[unison]] 

 (1) Perfect agreement. (2) Sameness of musical pitch. 

• Unable to read music well enough to harmonize, the village choir sang only in unison. 

This word usually appears in the phrase “in unison,” which means “together, at the same time” or “at
the  same  musical  pitch.”  So  an  excited  crowd  responding  to  a  speaker  may  shout  in  unison,  and  a
group of demonstrators may chant in unison. The old church music called Gregorian chant was written
to be sung in unison, with no harmonizing voices, and kindergarten kids always sing in unison (at least
when they can all find the same pitch). In a similar way, an aerobics class moves in unison following
the  instructor,  and  a  group  or  even  a  whole  town  may  work  in  unison  when  everyone  agrees  on  a
common goal.

- [[unitarian]] 
only in one person and stresses individual freedom of belief. 

 Relating or belonging to a religious group that believes that God exists

• With his unitarian tendencies, he wasn't likely to get into fights over religious beliefs. 

Unitarianism, originally a sect of Christianity believing in a single or unitary God, grew up in 18th-
century England and developed in America in the early 19th century. Though they believe in Christ's
teaching, they reject the idea of the three-part Trinity—God as father, son, and holy spirit—and thus
deny that Christ was divine, so some people don't consider them truly Christian. In this century the
Unitarians  joined  with  the  Universalist  Church,  a  movement  founded  on  a  belief  in  universal
salvation—that is, the saving of every soul from damnation after death. Both have always been liberal
and  fairly  small;  today  they  count  about  half  a  million  members.  Without  a  capital  letter,  unitarian
refers simply to belief in a unitary God, or in unity within some nonreligious system.
