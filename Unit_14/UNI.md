CRYPT comes from the Greek word for “hidden.” To encrypt a message is to encode it—that is, to
hide its meaning in code language. When a scientific term begins with crypto-, it always means that
there's something hidden about it .

crypt 
church. (2) A room or area in a large aboveground tomb. 

  (1)  A  room  completely  or  partly  underground,  especially  under  the  main  floor  of  a

• His old nightmare was of being locked in a crypt with corpses as his only companions. 

Hidden  under  the  main  floor  of  a  great  church  is  often  a  large  room,  often  with  a  tomb  as  its
centerpiece.  Many  major  European  churches  were  built  over  the  remains  of  a  saint—the  Vatican's
great St. Peter's Basilica is an example—and instead of having the coffin buried, it was often given its
spacious  room  below  ground  level.  In  a  large  aboveground  tomb,  or  mausoleum,  there  may  be
several small chambers for individual coffins, also called crypts; when the comic book Tales from
the Crypt made its first appearance in 1950, it was this meaning that the authors were referring to.

encrypt 

 (1) To convert into cipher. (2) To convert a message into code. 

• Messages on the group's Web site are encrypted in code words to keep law-enforcement agents from
understanding them. 

Codes aren't always in another language; people have always been able to communicate in ways that
conceal their real meaning. In countries ruled by dictators, novelists and playwrights have sometimes
managed to encrypt their messages, conveying political ideas to their audiences so that the authorities
never  notice.  But  encryption  today  usually  refers  to  a  complex  procedure  performed  on  electronic
text  to  make  sure  the  wrong  people—whether  a  nation's  enemies  or  a  business  competitor  (most
businesses  use  encryption  today)—can't  read  it.  And  sensitive  data  that  merely  resides  on  a
company's own computers is often encrypted as well.

cryptic 

 (1) Mysterious; puzzlingly short. (2) Acting to hide or conceal. 

• From across the room, Louisa threw Philip a cryptic look, and he puzzled over what she was trying
to tell him. 

Until the writing on the famous Rosetta Stone was finally translated in the early 19th century, Egyptian
hieroglyphic  writing  was  entirely  cryptic,  its  meaning  hidden  from  the  modern  world.  In  the  same
way,  a  cryptic  comment  is  one  whose  meaning  is  unclear,  and  a  cryptic  note  may  leave  you
wondering. Cryptic coloring among plants and animals acts like camouflage; so, for example, some
moths that are tasty to blue jays are cryptically colored to look like bugs that jays won't touch.

cryptography 

 (1) Secret writing. (2) The encoding and decoding of messages. 

• As a graduate student in mathematics, she never dreamed she would end up working in cryptography
for the Defense Department. 

During  World  War  II,  cryptography  became  an  extremely  complex  science  for  both  the  Allied  and
Axis powers. The Allies managed to secretly crack the code produced by the Nazis' Enigma machine,
and thereby may have shortened the war by two years. The Axis cryptographers, on the other hand,
never managed to crack the Americans' ultimate code—the spoken languages of the Navajo and other
American Indians. In the age of computers, cryptography has become almost unbelievably complex;
it's widely used in peacetime in such areas as banking telecommunications.

AB/ABS comes to us from Latin, and means “from,” “away,” or “off.” Abuse is the use of something
in the wrong way. To abduct is to “lead away from” or kidnap. Aberrant behavior is behavior that
“wanders away from” what is acceptable. But there are so many words that include these roots that it
would be absurd to try to list them all here.

abscond 

 To depart in secret and hide. 

• They discovered the next morning that their guest had absconded with most of the silverware during
the night. 

Wagner's  massive  four-part  opera  The  Ring  of  the  Nibelung  begins  with  a  dwarf  absconding  with
gold which he turns into a magic ring. And in J. R. R. Tolkien's The Hobbit, Bilbo Baggins absconds
from Gollum's caves with the ring he has found, the ring Gollum calls “my precious”; what follows is
detailed in the three-volume Lord of the Rings. (Tolkien knew Wagner's opera well.) A young couple
might  abscond  from  their  parents  to  get  married,  but  sooner  or  later  they  must  face  those  parents
again.

abstemious 

 Restrained, especially in the consumption of food or alcohol. 

• Her parents had left her two million dollars when they died, having been so abstemious for years
that their neighbors all assumed they were poor. 

Many  14th-century  monks  lived  by  the  Rule  of  St.  Benedict,  which  demands  an  abstemious  life  of
obedience  and  poverty.  But  not  all  monks  could  maintain  such  abstemious  habits.  Chaucer's
Canterbury Tales contains a portrait of a fat monk who is supposed to follow a vegetarian diet but
instead is an enthusiastic hunter who loves a juicy swan best. He justifies breaking the Rule by saying
that it's old-fashioned and that he's just keeping up with modern times. Abstemious itself has a slightly
old-fashioned  sound  today,  especially  in  a  country  where  everyone  is  constantly  encouraged  to
consume.

abstraction 
particular example. 

  The  consideration  of  a  thing  or  idea  without  associating  it  with  a

• All the ideas she came up with in class were abstractions, since she had no experience of actual
nursing at all. 

From its roots, abstraction should mean basically “something pulled or drawn away.” So abstract art
is  art  that  has  moved  away  from  painting  objects  of  the  ordinary  physical  world  in  order  to  show
something beyond it. Theories are often abstractions; so a theory about economics, for instance, may
“pull back” to take a broad view that somehow explains all of economics (but maybe doesn't end up
explaining  any  of  it  very  successfully).  An  abstract  of  a  medical  or  scientific  article  is  a  one-
paragraph summary of its contents—that is, the basic findings “pulled out” of the article.

abstruse 

 Hard to understand; deep or complex. 

•  In  every  class  he  fills  the  blackboard  with  abstruse  calculations,  and  we  usually  leave  more
confused than ever. 

The original meaning of abstruse, coming almost straight from the Latin, was “concealed, hidden.”
It's easy to see how the word soon came to describe the kind of language used by those who possess
certain  kinds  of  expert  knowledge  (and  don't  necessarily  want  to  share  it  with  other  people).
Scientific writing is often filled with the kind of abstruse special vocabulary that's necessary for exact
and precise descriptions. Unfortunately, the language of a science like quantum physics can make an
already difficult subject even more abstruse to the average person.

PED- [[comes]] from the Greek word for “child.” The same root also has the meaning “foot” (see PED),
but in English words it usually isn't hard to tell the two apart.

pedagogy 

 The art, science, or profession of teaching. 

• His own pedagogy is extremely original; it sometimes alarms school officials but his students love
it. 

Since in Greek agogos means “leader,” a paidagogos was a slave who led boys to school and back,
but also taught them manners and tutored them after school. In time, pedagogue came to mean simply
“teacher”; today the word has an old-fashioned ring to it, so it often means a stuffy, boring teacher.
The word pedagogy, though, is still widely used, and often means simply “teaching.” And pedagogic
training is what everyone majoring in education receives.

pedant 
learning. 

  (1)  A  formal,  unimaginative  teacher.  (2)  A  person  who  shows  off  his  or  her

• At one time or another, every student encounters a pedant who can make even the most interesting
subject tedious. 

It isn't always easy to tell a pedantic teacher from one who is simply thorough. Some professors get
an undeserved reputation for pedantry from students who just don't like the subject much. Regardless
of that, a pedant need not be a teacher; anyone who goes around displaying his or her knowledge in a
boring way can qualify.

pediatrician 
of children. 

 A doctor who specializes in the diseases, development, and care

• Children in the U.S. usually see a pediatrician until they turn at least 15 or 16. 

Since  iatros  means  “physician”  in  Greek  (see  IATR),  words  such  as  pediatric  naturally  refer  to
“children's medicine.” Pediatrics is a fairly new medical specialty; until about 1900, children were
considered small adults and given the same medical treatment, only milder. Benjamin Spock was the
most  famous  pediatrician  of  the  20th  century,  and  his  book  Baby  and  Child  Care  changed  the  way
millions of Americans raised their children.

encyclopedic 
of subjects. 

 (1) Of or relating to an encyclopedia. (2) Covering a wide range

• Someone with the kind of encyclopedic knowledge she has should be competing on Jeopardy. 

In  Greek,  paidaea  meant  not  simply  “child-rearing”  but  also  “education,”  and  kyklios  meant
“general”; thus, an encyclopedia is a work broad enough to provide a kind of general education. The
world's  most  eminent  general  encyclopedia,  the  Encyclopaedia  Britannica,  is  a  huge  work  that
covers every field of human knowledge. But encyclopedic doesn't have to refer to books; it's often
used to describe the wide-ranging knowledge that certain types of minds just can't stop acquiring.

TROP comes from the Greek tropos, meaning “turn” or “change.” The troposphere is the level of the
atmosphere  where  most  weather  changes—or  “turns  in  the  weather”—occur.  And  the  Tropics  of
Cancer and Capricorn are the lines of latitude where the sun is directly overhead when it reaches its
northernmost  and  southernmost  points,  on  about  June  22  and  December  22  every  year—that  is,  the
point where it seems to turn and go back the other way.

tropism 
place, especially a plant, that involves turning or growing toward or away from a stimulus. 

  Automatic  movement  by  an  organism  unable  to  move  about  from  place  to

• The new president was soon showing a tropism for bold action, a tendency that seemed more the
result of instinct than of careful thought. 

In hydrotropism, a plant's roots grow in the direction of increasing moisture, hoping to obtain water.
In phototropism,  a  plant  (or  fungus)  moves  toward  light,  usually  the  sun—perhaps  because,  in  the
colder climates where such plants are usually found, concentrating the sun's warmth within the sun-
seeking  flower  can  create  a  warm  and  inviting  environment  for  the  insects  that  fertilize  it.  In
thigmotropism, the organism moves in response to being touched; most climbing plants, for example,
put out tiny tendrils that feel around for something solid and then attach themselves or curl around it.
When microbiologists talk about tropism, however, they're often referring instead to the way a virus
will  seek  out  a  particular  type  of  cell  to  infect.  And  when  intellectuals  use  the  word,  they  usually
mean a tendency shown by a person or group which they themselves might not even be aware of.

entropy 
state of inactive uniformity. (2) Chaos, randomness. 

 (1) The decomposition of the matter and energy in the universe to an ultimate

•  The  apartment  had  been  reduced  to  an  advanced  state  of  entropy,  as  if  a  tiny  tornado  had  torn
through it, shattering its contents and mixing the pieces together in a crazy soup. 

With  its  Greek  prefix  en-,  meaning  “within,”  and  the  trop-  root  here  meaning  “change,”  entropy
basically  means  “change  within  (a  closed  system).”  The  closed  system  we  usually  think  of  when
speaking of entropy (especially if we're not physicists) is the entire universe. But entropy applies to
closed systems of any size. Entropy is seen when the ice in a glass of water in a warm room melts—
that is, as the temperature of everything in the room evens out. In a slightly different type of entropy, a
drop of food coloring in that glass of water soon spreads out evenly. However, when a nonphysicist
uses the word, he or she is usually trying to describe a large-scale collapse.

heliotrope 

 Any of a genus of herbs or shrubs having small white or purple flowers. 

• A long bank of purple heliotrope lined the walkway, and her guests were always remarking on the
flowers' glorious fragrance. 

Helios  was  the  god  of  the  sun  in  Greek  mythology,  and  helio-  came  to  appear  in  a  number  of  sun-
related English words. The genus known as the heliotropes consists of about 250 species; many are
thought  of  as  weeds,  but  the  best-known  species,  garden  heliotrope,  is  a  popular  and  fragrant
perennial  that  resembles  the  forget-me-not.  The  heliotrope  tends  to  follow  the  sun—that  is,  turn  its
blossoms  toward  the  sun  as  it  travels  from  East  to  West  every  day.  But  the  fact  is,  heliotropism—
turning toward the sun—is common among flowers (and even leaves), and some, like the sunflower,
are more dramatically heliotropic than the heliotrope. Those in the far North actually use their petals
to reflect the sun's heat onto the flower's central ovary during the short growing season.

psychotropic 

 Acting on the mind. 

• My mother is taking two drugs that may produce psychotropic side effects, and I'm worried that they
might be interacting. 

Psychotropic  is  used  almost  always  to  describe  substances  that  we  consume.  Such  substances  are
more  numerous  than  you  might  think,  and  some  have  been  known  for  thousands  of  years.  Native
American  religions,  for  example,  have  used  psychotropic  substances  derived  from  certain  cactuses
and  mushrooms  for  centuries.  Caffeine  and  nicotine  can  be  called  psychotropic.  Psychotropic
prescription drugs include antidepressants (such as Prozac) and tranquilizers (such as Valium). Any
medication that blocks pain, from aspirin to the anesthetics used during surgery, can be considered a
psychotropic  drug.  Even  children  are  now  prescribed  psychotropic  drugs,  often  to  treat  attention
deficit disorder. And all recreational drugs are psychotropic. Psychoactive is a common synonym of
psychotropic.

NEO comes from the Greek neos, meaning “new.” Neo- [[has]] become a part of many English words.
Some are easy to understand; for example, neo-Nazi.  Some  are  less  so;  you  might  not  immediately
guess  that  neotropical  means  “from  the  tropics  of  the  New  World,”  or  that  a  neophyte  is  a
“newcomer.” When William Ramsay discovered four new gases, he named them all using Greek roots
that  at  first  glance  might  sound  slightly  mysterious:  argon  (“idle”),  krypton  (“hidden”),  xenon
(“strange”)—and neon (“new”).

neoclassic 
Roman, especially in music, art, or architecture. 

  Relating  to  a  revival  or  adaptation  of  the  styles  of  ancient  Greece  and

•  He  had  always  admired  the  paintings  of  the  French  neoclassical  masters,  especially  Poussin  and
Ingres. 

In the arts and architecture, a style that has existed for a long time usually produces a reaction against
it. So after the showy style of Europe's so-called baroque era (from about 1600 to the early 1700s),
the reaction came in the form of the neoclassical movement, bringing order, restraint, and simpler and
more  conservative  structures,  whether  in  plays,  sonatas,  sculptures,  or  public  buildings.  Its
inspiration was the art of ancient Greece and Rome—that is, of classical antiquity. Why classical? In
Latin classicus meant “of the highest class,” so in English classic and classical originally described
the  best  ancient  Greek  and  Latin  literature,  but  soon  came  to  mean  simply  “of  ancient  Greek  and
Rome,”  since  these  were  already  seen  as  the  highest  and  best  cultures.  Neoclassic  generally
describes artworks from the 1700s or early 1800s (by the painter David, the composer Mozart, the
sculptor Canova, etc.), but also works from the 20th century that seem to have been inspired by the
ideals of Greece and Rome.

Neolithic 
tools were used. 

  Of  or  relating  to  the  latest  period  of  the  Stone  Age,  when  polished  stone

• Around the Mediterranean, the Neolithic period was a time of trade, of stock breeding, and of the
first use of pottery. 

Since lithos in Greek means “stone,” the Neolithic period is the “new” or “late” period of the Stone
Age, in contrast to the Paleolithic period (“old” or “early” period—see PALEO) and the Mesolithic
period (“middle” period) of the Stone Age. The use of polished stone tools came to different parts of
the world at different times, but the Neolithic Age is usually said to begin around 9000 B.C. and to
end  around  3000  B.C.,  when  the  Bronze  Age  begins.  The  Neolithic  is  the  era  when  the  farming  of
plants and animals begins, and when, as a result, humans first begin to create permanent settlements.

neoconservative 
democracy and the U.S. national interest in world affairs, including through military means. 

  A  conservative  who  favors  strongly  encouraging

• Many believed that foreign policy in those years had fallen into the hands of the neoconservatives,
and that the war in Iraq was one result. 

In  the  1960s  several  well-known  socialist  intellectuals,  including  Norman  Podhoretz  and  Irving
Kristol,  alarmed  by  growing  political  extremism  on  the  left,  began  to  move  in  the  other  direction.
Soon the term neoconservative (or neocon for short) was being attached to them. Rather than simply
drifting toward the political center, Podhoretz and Kristol actually moved far to the right, especially
on the issue of maintaining a strong military stance toward the rest of the world. The main magazine
of neoconservatism became Podhoretz's Commentary;  it  was  later  joined  by  the  Weekly  Standard,
edited by Kristol's son William. Not everyone agrees on how to define these terms; still, it's clear that
today you don't have to be a former liberal in order to be a neoconservative.

neonatal 

 Of or relating to babies in the first month after their birth. 

• The hospital's newest addition is a neonatal intensive-care unit, and newborns in critical condition
are already being sent there from considerable distances. 

Partly based on the Latin natus, “born,” neonatal means “newly born.” Neonatal babies themselves
are called neonates. Most hospitals now offer neonatal screening, which is used to detect diseases
that are treatable only if identified during the first days of life, and specialized neonatal nursing as
well. But despite spending much money on neonatal care, the U.S. still ranks lower than some much
less  wealthy  countries  (such  as  the  Czech  Republic,  Portugal,  and  Cuba)  in  infant  mortality  (infant
deaths).

NOV comes from the Latin word novus, meaning “new.” To renovate an old house is to “make it new
again”—that  is,  put  it  back  in  tip-top  shape.  The  long-running  PBS  show  Nova  keeps  its  large
audience up to date on what's new in the world of science. And when the British king sent Scottish
settlers to a large island off Canada's Atlantic coast in the 17th century, he named it Nova Scotia, or
“New Scotland.”

novice 
beginner. (2) A new member of a religious order who is preparing to become a nun or monk. 

 (1) One who has no previous training or experience in a specific field or activity;

• It's hard to believe that a year ago she was a complete novice as a gardener, who couldn't identify a
cornstalk. 

Among the ancient Romans, a novice (novicius) was usually a newly imported slave, who had to be
trained in his or her duties. Among Catholics and Buddhists, if you desire to become a priest, monk,
or nun, you must serve as a novice for a period of time, often a year (called your novitiate), before
being ordained or fully professing your vows. No matter what kind of novice you are—at computers,
at writing, at politics, etc.—you've got a lot to learn.

novel 
striking, especially in conception or style. 

  (1)  New  and  not  resembling  something  formerly  known  or  used.  (2)  Original  and

•  His  techniques  for  dealing  with  these  disturbed  young  people  were  novel,  and  they  caught  the
attention of the institute's director. 

If someone tells you that you've come up with a novel idea or a novel interpretation of something, it's
probably  a  compliment:  not  everyone  is  capable  of  original  thinking.  But  not  everything  new  is
terribly worthwhile; a novelty, for example, is often a cute (or maybe just silly) little object that you
might  put  on  a  display  shelf  in  your  house.  It  may  seem  surprising  that  the  familiar  noun  novel  is
related as well. In the 14th century, Italian writers began writing collections of short tales, each of
which  they  called  a  novella  because  it  represented  a  new  literary  form;  from  this  word,  three
centuries later, the English coined the noun novel.

innovation 
devices, or methods. 

 (1) A new idea, device, or method. (2) The introduction of new ideas,

•  “Smooshing”  bits  of  candy  into  ice  cream  while  the  customer  watched  was  just  one  of  his
innovations that later got copied by chains of ice-cream outlets. 

Innovation is a word that's almost always connected with business. In business today, it's almost a
rule that a company that doesn't innovate is destined for failure. The most important and successful
businesses were usually started by innovators. And company managers should always at least listen
to the innovative ideas of their employees.

supernova 
(2) Something that explodes into prominence or popularity. 

 (1) The explosion of a star that causes it to become extremely bright.

•  After  exploding,  a  nova  leaves  a  “white  dwarf”  which  may  explode  again  in  the  future,  but  a
supernova destroys the entire star. 

A  nova,  despite  its  name,  isn't  actually  a  “new”  star,  but  rather  one  that  wasn't  noticed  until  it
exploded, when it may increase in brightness by a million times before returning to its previous state
a few days later. A supernova is far larger; a star in its supernova state may emit a billion times as
much light as previously. After a few weeks it begins to dim, until it eventually ceases to exist; it's
often replaced by a black hole. (Though remains that were shot out into space may survive; those of a
great  supernova  seen  in  A.D.  1054  are  now  known  as  the  Crab  Nebula.)  All  this  may  serve  as  a
warning  to  those  human  stars  whose  fame  explodes  too  rapidly;  supernovas  of  this  kind  have
sometimes vanished by the following year.

POS comes from the Latin verb ponere, meaning “to put” or “to place.” You expose film by “placing
it  out”  in  the  light.  You  compose  a  song  by  “putting  together”  a  series  of  notes.  And  you  oppose
locating a new prison in your town by “putting yourself against” it.

impose 
To take unfair advantage. 

 (1) To establish or apply as a charge or penalty or in a forceful or harmful way. (2)

• After seeing her latest grades, her parents imposed new rules about how much time she had to spend
on homework every night. 

The Latin imposui meant “put upon,” and that meaning carried over into English in impose. A CEO
may impose a new manager on one of the company's plants. A state may impose new taxes on luxury
items  or  cigarettes,  and  the  federal  government  sometimes  imposes  trade  restrictions  on  another
country  to  punish  it.  A  polite  apology  might  begin  with  “I  hope  I'm  not  imposing  on  you”  (that  is,
“forcing my presence on you”). And a self-imposed deadline is one that you decide to hold yourself
to.

juxtapose 

 To place side by side. 

• You won't notice the difference between the original and the copy unless you juxtapose them. 

Since  juxta  means  “near”  in  Latin,  it's  easy  to  see  how  juxtapose  was  formed.  Juxtaposing  is
generally  done  for  examination  or  effect.  Interior  designers  constantly  make  decisions  about
juxtaposing objects and colors for the best effect. Juxtaposing two video clips showing the different
things that a politician said about the same subject at two different times can be an effective means of
criticizing. The juxtaposition  of  two  similar  X-rays  can  help  medical  students  distinguish  between
two conditions that may be hard to tell apart. And advertisements frequently juxtapose “before” and
“after” images to show a thrilling transformation.

transpose

• She rechecked the phone number and discovered that two digits had been transposed. 

Though  transposing  two  digits  can  be  disastrous,  transposing  two  letters  in  a  word  often  doesn't
matter too much. (You can prboalby raed tihs setnence witohut too mcuh toruble.) Transposing two
words or sounds—as in “Can I sew you to another sheet?”—has been a good source of humor over
the years. Doctors sometimes discover that something in the body—a nerve, an organ, etc.—has been
transposed, or moved away from its proper place. For musicians, transposing means changing the key
of a piece; if you can do this at a moment's notice, you've been well trained.

superimpose 

 To put or place one thing over something else. 

• Using transparent sheets, she superimposes territory boundaries on an outline of Africa, showing us
how these changed in the late 19th and early 20th century. 

Superimposition was one of the magical effects employed by early filmmakers. Using “mirror shots,”
with semitransparent mirrors set at 45° angles to the scene, they would superimpose shadowy images
of  ghosts  or  scenes  from  a  character's  past  onto  scenes  from  the  present.  Superimposing  your  own
ideas on something, such as a historical event, has to be done carefully, since your ideas may change
whenever you learn something new about the event.

TEN, from the Latin verb tenere, basically means “hold” or “hold on to.” A tenant is the “holder” of
an  apartment,  house,  or  land,  but  not  necessarily  the  owner.  A  lieutenant  governor  may  “hold  the
position” ( “serve in lieu”) of the governor when necessary.

tenure 
keep a job, especially the job of teacher or professor. 

 (1) The amount of time that a person holds a job, office, or title. (2) The right to

• I know two assistant professors who are so worried about being denied tenure this year that they
can't sleep. 

Tenure  is  about  holding  on  to  something,  almost  always  a  job  or  position.  So  you  can  speak  of
someone's  30-year  tenure  as  chairman,  or  someone's  brief  tenure  in  the  sales  manager's  office.  But
tenure  means  something  slightly  different  in  the  academic  world.  In  American  colleges  and
universities,  the  best  (or  luckiest)  teachers  have  traditionally  been  granted  a  lifetime  appointment
known as tenure after about six years of teaching. Almost nobody has as secure a job as a tenured
professor, but getting tenure can be difficult, and most of them have earned it.

tenacious 

 Stubborn or determined in clinging to something. 

• He was known as a tenacious reporter who would stay with a story for months, risking his health
and sometimes even his life. 

Success  in  most  fields  requires  a  tenacious  spirit  and  a  drive  to  achieve.  Nowhere  is  this  more
apparent than in the entertainment business. Thousands of actors and actresses work tenaciously to
build a TV or film career. But without talent or beauty, tenacity is rarely rewarded, and only a few
become stars.

tenable 

 Capable of being held or defended; reasonable. 

• She was depressed for weeks after her professor said that her theory wasn't tenable. 

Tenable means “holdable.” In the past it was often used in a physical sense—for example, to refer to
a city that an army was trying to “hold” militarily against an enemy force. But nowadays it's almost
always used when speaking of “held” ideas and theories. If you hold an opinion but evidence appears
that completely contradicts it, your opinion is no longer tenable. So, for example, the old ideas that
cancer is infectious or that being bled by leeches can cure your whooping cough now seem untenable.

tenet 
group or profession. 

 A widely held principle or belief, especially one held in common by members of a

• It was soon obvious that the new owners didn't share the tenets that the company's founders had held
to all those years. 

A tenet is something we hold, but not with our hands. Tenets are often ideals, but also often statements
of faith. Thus, we may speak of the tenets of Islam or Hinduism, the tenets of Western democracy, or
the tenets of the scientific method, and in each case these tenets may combine elements of both faith
and ideals.

Number Words

MONO comes from the Greek monos, meaning “along” or “single.” So a monorail is a railroad that
has only one rail; a monocle is an old-fashioned eyeglass that a gentleman used to squeeze into his
eye socket; a monotonous voice seems to have only one tone; and a monopoly puts all ownership of a
type of product or service in the hands of a single company.

monogamous 

 Being married to one person or having one mate at a time. 

• Geese, swans, and most other birds are monogamous and mate for life. 

American marriage is by law monogamous; people are permitted to have only one spouse (husband or
wife) at a time. There are cultures with laws that permit marriage to more than one person at a time,
or polygamy. Some Islamic countries permit polygamy, as do some African tribes. In this country the
Mormons  were  polygamous  until  1890,  when  they  were  forced  to  adopt  monogamy  by  the
unsympathetic federal government.

monoculture 
of land. (2) A culture dominated by a single element. 

 (1) The cultivation of a single crop to the exclusion of other uses

• Monoculture is practiced on a vast scale in the American Midwest, where nothing but corn can be
seen in the fields for hundreds of square miles. 

The Irish Potato Famine of 1845-49, which led to the deaths of over a million people, resulted from
the monoculture of potatoes, which were destroyed by a terrible blight, leaving farmers nothing else
to eat. Almost every traditional farming society has practiced crop rotation, the planting of different
crops on a given piece of land from year to year, so as to keep the soil from losing its quality. But in
the modern world, monoculture has become the rule on the largest commercial farms, where the same
crop can be planted year after year by means of the intensive use of fertilizers. Modern monoculture
has  produced  huge  crops;  on  a  large  scale,  it  permits  great  efficiency  in  planting,  pest  control,  and
harvesting. But many experts believe this all comes at a huge cost to the environment.

monolithic 
of material with no joints or seams. 

 (1) Appearing to be a huge, featureless, often rigid whole. (2) Made up

• The sheer monolithic rock face of Yosemite's El Capitan looks impossible to climb, but its cracks
and seams are enough for experienced rock climbers. 

The -lith in monolith comes from the Greek lithos, “stone,” so monolith in its original sense means a
huge  stone  like  those  at  Stonehenge.  What's  so  impressive  about  monoliths  is  that  they  have  no
separate parts or pieces. To the lone individual, any huge institution or government bureaucracy can
seem  monolithic.  But  the  truth  may  be  different:  The  former  U.S.S.R.  once  seemed  monolithic  and
indestructible to the West, but in the 1990s it crumbled into a number of independent republics.

monotheism 

 The worship of a single god. 

•  Christian  monotheism  finally  triumphed  in  the  Roman  Empire  in  A.D.  392,  when  the  worship  of
pagan gods and goddesses was forbidden. 

The monotheism of the ancient Hebrews had to combat the polytheism (worship of many gods) of the
surrounding  peoples  from  the  earliest  times.  As  the  Bible  relates,  several  times  in  their  history  the
Hebrews  turned  away  from  their  monotheistic  beliefs  and  accepted  foreign  gods,  such  as  those
imported by King Solomon. Each time their own God would punish them for their disloyalty, and the
people of Israel would return to monotheism. Today Judaism shares its monotheism with two much
larger religions, Christianity and Islam.

UNI comes from the Latin word for “one.” A uniform is a single design worn by everyone. A united
group has one single opinion, or forms a single unit. A unitard is a one-piece combination leotard
and tights, very good for skating, skiing, dancing—or riding a one-wheeled unicycle.

unicameral 

 Having only one lawmaking chamber. 

• In China, with its unicameral system of government, a single group of legislators meets to make the
laws. 

Unicameral means “one-chambered,” and the term almost always describes a governing body. Our
federal legislature, like those of most democracies, is bicameral, with two legislative (lawmaking)
bodies—the  Senate  and  the  House  of  Representatives.  And  except  for  Nebraska,  all  the  state
legislatures are also bicameral. So why did the nation decide on a bicameral system? Partly in order
to keep some power out of the hands of ordinary voters, who the Founding Fathers didn't completely
trust.  For  that  reason,  the  original  Constitution  states  that  senators  are  to  be  elected  by  the  state
legislatures; not until 1914, after passage of a Constitutional amendment, did we first cast direct votes
for our senators.

unilateral 
the body. 

 (1) Done by one person or party; one-sided. (2) Affecting one side of

• The Japanese Constitution of 1947 includes a unilateral rejection of warfare as an option for their
country. 

The world is a smaller place than it used to be, and we get uncomfortable when a single nation adopts
a  policy  of  unilateralism—that  is,  acting  independently  with  little  regard  for  what  the  rest  of  the
world  thinks.  A  unilateral  invasion  of  another  country,  for  instance,  usually  looks  like  a  grab  for
power  and  resources.  But  occasionally  the  world  welcomes  a  unilateral  action,  as  when  the  U.S.
announced unilateral nuclear-arms reductions in the early 1990s. Previously, such reductions had only
happened  as  part  of  bilateral  (“two-sided”)  agreements  with  the  old  Soviet  Union.  Multilateral
agreements, on issues such as climate change, often involve most of the world's nations.

unison 

 (1) Perfect agreement. (2) Sameness of musical pitch. 

• Unable to read music well enough to harmonize, the village choir sang only in unison. 

This word usually appears in the phrase “in unison,” which means “together, at the same time” or “at
the  same  musical  pitch.”  So  an  excited  crowd  responding  to  a  speaker  may  shout  in  unison,  and  a
group of demonstrators may chant in unison. The old church music called Gregorian chant was written
to be sung in unison, with no harmonizing voices, and kindergarten kids always sing in unison (at least
when they can all find the same pitch). In a similar way, an aerobics class moves in unison following
the  instructor,  and  a  group  or  even  a  whole  town  may  work  in  unison  when  everyone  agrees  on  a
common goal.

unitarian 
only in one person and stresses individual freedom of belief. 

 Relating or belonging to a religious group that believes that God exists

• With his unitarian tendencies, he wasn't likely to get into fights over religious beliefs. 

Unitarianism, originally a sect of Christianity believing in a single or unitary God, grew up in 18th-
century England and developed in America in the early 19th century. Though they believe in Christ's
teaching, they reject the idea of the three-part Trinity—God as father, son, and holy spirit—and thus
deny that Christ was divine, so some people don't consider them truly Christian. In this century the
Unitarians  joined  with  the  Universalist  Church,  a  movement  founded  on  a  belief  in  universal
salvation—that is, the saving of every soul from damnation after death. Both have always been liberal
and  fairly  small;  today  they  count  about  half  a  million  members.  Without  a  capital  letter,  unitarian
refers simply to belief in a unitary God, or in unity within some nonreligious system.
