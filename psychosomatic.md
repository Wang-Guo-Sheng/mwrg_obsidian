心身的

Caused by mental or emotional problems rather than by physical illness. 

•  Her  doctor  assumed  her  stomach  problems  were  psychosomatic  but  gave  her  some  harmless medication anyway. 

Since the Greek word *soma* means “body,” psychosomatic suggests the link between mind and body.
Since  one's  mental  state  may  have  an  important  effect  on  one's  physical  state,  research  on  new medicines  always  involves  giving  some  patients  in  the  experiment  a  placebo  (fake  medicine),  and some who receive the sugar pills will seem to improve. You may hear someone say of someone else's symptoms,  “Oh,  it's  probably  just  psychosomatic,”  implying  that  the  physical  pain  or  illness  is imaginary—maybe just an attempt to get sympathy—and that the person could will it away if he or she wanted to. But this can be harsh and unfair, since, whatever the cause is, the pain is usually real.
