- VEST comes from the Latin verb vestire, “to clothe” or “to dress,” and the noun vestis, “clothing” or
“garment.” Vest is the shortest English word we have from this root, and is the name of a rather small
piece of clothing.

- [[divest]] 
clothing, ornaments, or equipment. 

  (1)  To  get  rid  of  or  free  oneself  of  property,  authority,  or  title.  (2)  To  strip  of

• In protest against apartheid, many universities in the 1980s divested themselves of all stock in South
African companies. 

If  you  decide  to  enter  a  monastery,  you  may  divest  yourself  of  most  of  your  possessions.  When  a
church is officially abandoned, it's usually divested of its ornaments and furnishings. A company that's
going  through  hard  times  may  divest  itself  of  several  stores,  and  investors  are  constantly  divesting
themselves of stocks that aren't performing well enough. And when it turns out that athletes have been
using steroids, they're usually divested of any awards they may have won.

- [[investiture]] 

 The formal placing of someone in office. 

• At an English monarch's investiture, he or she is presented with the crown, scepter, and sword, the
symbols of power. 

In  its  original  meaning,  an  investiture  was  the  clothing  of  a  new  officeholder  in  garments  that
symbolized power. The Middle Ages saw much debate over the investiture of bishops by kings and
emperors. These rulers felt that high religious offices were theirs to give as rewards for someone's
loyal service or as bribes for someone's future support; the popes, on the other hand, regarded these
investitures  as  the  improper  buying  and  selling  of  church  offices.  The  investiture  struggle  caused
tension between popes and monarchs and even led to wars.

- [[transvestite]] 
mannerisms of the opposite sex. 

  A  person,  especially  a  male,  who  wears  the  clothing  and  adopts  the

• In Handel's operas, the heroic male leading roles are today often sung by female transvestites, since
he originally wrote them for the soprano range. 

Transvestite  includes  the  prefix  trans-,  “across,”  and  thus  means  literally  “cross-dresser.”  In  the
theater, from ancient Greece to Elizabethan England, transvestism was common because all parts—
even  Juliet—were  played  by  men.  Traditional  Japanese  Kabuki  and  Noh  drama  still  employ
transvestism of this sort. In everyday life, it's now so acceptable for women to wear men's clothing
that  the  word  transvestite  is  generally  applied  only  to  men.  The  much  newer  word  transgender
describes people who think of themselves as having changed sex, or who simply don't believe in the
idea that they're either one sex or the other.

- [[travesty]] 
literature, or art that is usually grotesque and ridiculous. 

 (1) An inferior or distorted imitation. (2) A broadly comic imitation in drama,

• The senator was shouting that the new tax bill represented a travesty of tax reform. 

The word travesty comes from the same prefix and root as transvestite. Since cross-dressing often
isn't  very  convincing,  the  word  has  usually  referred  to  something  absurd.  So  a  verdict  that  angers
people  may  be  denounced  as  a  “travesty  of  justice.”  Saturday  Night  Live  specializes  in  dramatic
travesties  mocking  everything  from  political  figures  and  issues  to  popular  culture—“disguised”
versions  intended  for  entertainment.  Travesty  may  also  be  a  verb;  thus,  Mel  Brooks  has  travestied
movie genres of all kinds—westerns, thrillers, and silent films, among others.
