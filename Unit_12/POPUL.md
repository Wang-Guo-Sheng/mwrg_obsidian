- POPUL comes from the Latin word meaning “people,” and in fact forms the basis of the word people
itself. So the population is the people of an area, and popular means not only “liked by many people”
but also (as in popular culture) “relating to the general public.”

- [[populist]] 

 A believer in the rights, wisdom, or virtues of the common people. 

• He knew he would have to campaign as a populist in order to appeal to the working-class voters. 

The word populist first appeared in the 1890s with the founding of the Populist Party, which stood for
the  interests  of  the  farmers  against  the  big-money  interests.  In  later  years  populism  came  to  be
associated  with  the  blue-collar  class  in  the  cities  as  well.  Populism  can  be  hard  to  predict.  It
sometimes  has  a  religious  tendency;  it  usually  isn't  very  interested  in  international  affairs;  it  has
sometimes been unfriendly to immigrants and blacks; and it's often anti-intellectual. So populism often
switches  between  liberal  and  conservative.  But  the  populist  style  always  shows  its  concern  with
Americans with average incomes as opposed to the rich and powerful.

- [[populace]] 

 (1) The common people or masses. (2) Population. 

•  Perhaps  Henry  Ford's  major  achievement  was  to  manufacture  a  car  that  practically  the  entire
populace could afford—the Model T. 

Populace is usually used to refer to all the people of a country. Thus, we're often told that an educated
and  informed  populace  is  essential  for  a  healthy  American  democracy.  Franklin  D.  Roosevelt's
famous  radio  “Fireside  Chats”  informed  and  reassured  the  American  populace  in  the  1930s  as  we
struggled through the Great Depression. We often hear about what “the general populace” is thinking
or doing, but generalizing about something so huge can be tricky.

- [[populous]] 

 Numerous, densely settled, or having a large population. 

• Most Americans can't locate Indonesia, the fourth most populous country in the world, on a map. 

With a metropolitan area of more than 20 million people, Mexico City could be called the world's
second or third most populous city. And the nearby Aztec city of Tenochtitlán was one of the largest
cities in the world even when Hernán Cortés arrived there in 1519. But by the time Cortés conquered
the  city  in  1521  it  wasn't  nearly  so  populous,  since  European  diseases  had  greatly  reduced  the
population. Avoid confusing populous and populace, which are pronounced exactly the same.

- [[vox]] populi 

 Popular sentiment or opinion. 

•  Successful  politicians  are  always  listening  to  the  vox  populi  and  adjusting  their  opinions  or
language accordingly. 

Dating from at least the time of Charlemagne, the Latin saying “Vox populi, vox Dei” means literally
“The voice of the people is the voice of God”—in other words, the people's voice is sacred, or the
people are always right. Today, by means of modern opinion polls, we seem to hear the vox populi
(or vox pop for short) year-round on every possible issue. But maybe we should occasionally keep in
mind that full Charlemagne-era quotation: “Those people should not be listened to who keep saying
the voice of the people is the voice of God, since the riotousness of the crowd is always very close to
madness.”

- Animal Words

aquiline 

 (1) Relating to eagles. (2) Curving like an eagle's beak. 

• The surviving busts of noble Romans show that many of the men had strong aquiline noses. 

Aquiline, from the Latin word meaning “eagle,” is most often used to describe a nose that has a broad
curve and is slightly hooked, like a beak. The aquiline figure on the U.S. seal brandishes the arrows
of  war  and  the  olive  branch  of  peace.  The  word  for  eagle  itself,  Aquila,  has  been  given  to  a
constellation in the northern hemisphere.

- [[asinine]] 

 Foolish, brainless. 

• He's not so great when he's sober, but when he's drunk he gets truly asinine. 

The donkey, or ass, has often been accused of stubborn, willful, and stupid behavior lacking in logic
and common sense. Asinine behavior exhibits similar qualities. Idiotic or rude remarks, aggressive
stupidity,  and  general  immaturity  can  all  earn  someone  (usually  a  man)  this  description.  If  you  call
him this to his face, however, he might behave even worse.

- [[bovine]] 

 (1) Relating to cows and oxen. (2) Placid, dull, unemotional. 

• In that part of Texas, many of the veterinarians specialize in bovine conditions and won't even deal
with dogs or cats. 

Bovine  comes  from  the  Latin  word  for  “cow,”  though  the  biological  family  called  the  Bovidae
actually includes not only cows and oxen but also goats, sheep, bison, and buffalo. So bovine is often
used  technically,  when  discussing  “bovine  diseases,”  “bovine  anatomy,”  and  so  on.  It  can  also
describe a human personality, though it can be a rather unkind way to describe someone. When Hera,
the  wife  of  Zeus,  is  called  “cow-eyed,”  though,  it's  definitely  a  compliment,  and  Zeus  fairly  melts
when she turns those big bovine eyes on him.

- [[canine]] 

 Relating to dogs or the dog family; doglike. 

• Pleasure in getting their tummies rubbed must be a basic canine trait, since all our dogs have loved
it. 

Dogs  are  prized  for  their  talents  and  intelligence  but  aren't  always  given  credit  for  their
independence. Instead, tales of canine devotion and attachment are legendary; the old Lassie and Rin-
Tin-Tin  television  series  featured  at  least  one  heroic  act  of  devotion  per  show.  So  we  often  hear
people described as having “doglike devotion” or “doglike loyalty.” But canine itself, unlike doglike,
usually  refers  to  four-legged  creatures.  Canine  is  not  only  an  adjective  but  also  a  noun.  Dogs  and
their  relatives  in  the  Canidae  family—the  wolves,  jackals,  foxes,  and  coyotes—are  often  called
canines. And so are those two slightly pointed teeth a bit to the right and left of your front teeth.

- [[feline]] 
treacherous, or stealthy. 

  (1)  Relating  to  cats  or  the  cat  family.  (2)  Like  a  cat  in  being  sleek,  graceful,  sly,

• The performers moved across the high wire with feline grace and agility. 

Cats have always provoked a strong reaction from humans. The Egyptians worshipped them, leaving
thousands  of  feline  mummies  and  idols  as  evidence.  In  the  Middle  Ages,  felines  were  feared  as
agents of the devil, and were thought to creep around silently at night doing evil. (Notice that feline is
also a noun.) The fascinating family called the Felidae includes about 40 species of superb hunters,
including the lions, tigers, jaguars, cheetahs, cougars, bobcats, and lynxes, and almost all of them are
smooth, silent, and independent.

- [[leonine]] 

 Relating to lions; lionlike. 

• As he conducted, Leonard Bernstein would fling his leonine mane wildly about. 

The  Latin  word  for  “lion”  is  leon,  so  the  names  Leon,  Leo,  and  Leona  all  mean  “lion”  as  well.  A
leonine head usually has magnificent hair, like a male lion's mane. The leonine strength of Heracles
(Hercules) is symbolized by the lion's pelt that he wears, the pelt of the fabled Nemean Lion which he
had  slain  as  one  of  his  Twelve  Labors.  But  leonine  courage  is  what  is  so  notably  lacking  in  The
Wizard of Oz's Cowardly Lion.

- [[porcine]] 

 Relating to pigs or swine; piglike. 

• She describes her landlord's shape as porcine, and claims he has manners to match. 

Pigs  are  rarely  given  credit  for  their  high  intelligence  or  their  friendliness  as  pets,  but  instead  are
mocked  for  their  habit  of  cooling  themselves  in  mud  puddles  and  the  aggressive  way  they  often  go
after  food.  While  porcine  isn't  as  negative  a  term  as  swinish,  it  may  describe  things  that  are  fat,
greedy, pushy, or generally piggish—but primarily fat. Porky Pig and Miss Piggy aren't particularly
porcine in their behavior, only in their appearance—that is, pink and pudgy.

- [[vulpine]] 

 (1) Relating to foxes; foxlike. (2) Sneaky, clever, or crafty; foxy. 

•  She'd  already  decided  she  didn't  like  anything  about  him,  especially  the  twitchiness,  that  vulpine
face, and those darting eyes. 

Foxes may be sleek and graceful runners with beautiful coats and tails, but they're almost impossible
to keep out of the henhouse. Over the centuries they have “outfoxed” countless farmers. Because of
the  quick  intelligence  in  their  faces  and  their  cunning  nighttime  raids,  vulpine  today  almost  always
describes a face or manner that suggests a person capable of the same kind of sly scheming.
