- URB comes from the Latin noun for “city.” Our word urban describes cities and the people who live
in  them.  With  its  sub-  prefix  (see  SUB),  a  suburb  is  a  town  “near”  or  “under”  a  larger  city,  and
suburban houses are home to suburbanites.

- [[urbane]] 

 Sophisticated and with polished manners. 

• He was remembered as a gentlemanly and urbane host of elegant dinner parties. 

Urbane's synonyms include suave, debonair, and especially cosmopolitan. Urbanity was a trait of
such  classic  movie  stars  as  Fred  Astaire,  Cary  Grant,  William  Powell,  Leslie  Howard,  Charles
Boyer, and George Sanders. (Notice that, for some reason, urbane is almost always used to describe
men rather than women.) Teenagers in the 1960s read James Bond novels and watched his character
onscreen  to  get  tips  about  acquiring  an  urbane  identity.  But  it's  hard  to  acquire  urbanity  without
actually having had wide social experience in sophisticated cities. And, since times have changed, the
whole notion doesn't seem to attract young people quite the way it used to.

- [[exurban]] 
its suburbs and often is inhabited chiefly by well-to-do families. 

 Relating to a region or settlement that lies outside a city and usually beyond

• Exurban areas typically show much higher education and income levels than closer-in suburbs or
nearby rural counties. 

With  its  prefix  ex-,  (“outside  of,”  the  noun  exurb  was  coined  around  1955  to  describe  the  ring  of
well-off  communities  beyond  the  suburbs  that  were  becoming  commuter  towns  for  an  urban  area.
Most exurbs were probably quiet little towns before being discovered by young city dwellers with
good incomes looking for a pleasant place to raise their children. Planners, advertisers, and political
strategists  today  often  talk  about  such  topics  as  exurban  development,  exurban  trends,  exurban
migration, and exurban voters.

- [[interurban]] 

 Going between or connecting cities or towns. 

•  Businesspeople  in  the  two  cities  have  been  waiting  for  decades  for  a  true  high-speed  interurban
railway on the Japanese model. 

Interurban  is  generally  used  to  describe  transportation.  As  a  noun  (as  in  “In  those  days  you  could
take  the  interurban  from  Seattle  to  Tacoma”),  interurban  has  meant  a  fairly  heavy  but  fast  electric
train,  something  between  an  urban  trolley  and  a  full-fledged  long-distance  train,  that  offers  more
frequent  service  than  an  ordinary  railway.  Interurban  transit  today  may  include  bus,  ferry,  and
limousine—and, in a few lucky areas, a regional railway. With oil supplies dwindling, there's hope
that interurban railways will be coming back into wider use.

- [[urbanization]] 
larger as more and more people begin living and working in central areas. 

 The process by which towns and cities are formed and become

• The area has been undergoing rapid urbanization, and six or seven of the old small towns are now
genuine suburbs. 

The word urbanization started appearing in print way back in the 1880s, which says something about
the growth of American cities. The expansion of Los Angeles was an early example of uncontrolled
urbanization. Urbanization is often seen as a negative trend, with bad effects on quality of life and the
environment. But apartments require much less heat than houses, and commuting by mass transit rather
than cars can reduce pollution and energy use, and cities offer improved opportunities for jobs (and
often for education and housing as well), so city growth doesn't make everyone unhappy.

- CULT comes from the Latin cultus, meaning “care.” So cultivation is care of something, such as a
