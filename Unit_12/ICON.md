- ICON comes from the Greek eikon, which led to the Latin icon, both meaning “image.” Though the
icon-  root  hasn't  produced  many  English  words,  the  words  that  is  does  appear  in  tend  to  be
interesting.

- [[icon]] 
symbol. 

  (1)  A  religious  image  usually  painted  on  a  small  wooden  panel:  idol.  (2)  Emblem,

• Henry Ford's assembly line captured the imagination of the world, and he and his company became
icons of industrial capitalism. 

In the Eastern Orthodox church, much importance is given to icons, usually small portraits on wood—
sometimes with gold-leaf paint—of Jesus, Mary, or a saint, which hang in churches and in the houses
of  the  faithful.  The  Orthodox  church  favors  icons  partly  because  they  communicate  directly  and
forcefully even to uneducated people. They are regarded as sacred; some believers actually pray to
them, and many believe that icons have carried out miracles. The common modern uses of icon grew
out of this original sense. The fact that Orthodox icons have a symbolic role led to icon being used to
mean  simply  “symbol.”  Because  of  the  icon's  sacredness,  the  term  also  came  to  mean  “idol.”  And
once we began to use idol to refer to pop-culture stars, it wasn't long before we began using icon the
same way. But for the little computer-desktop images that you click on, the older meaning of “symbol”
is the one we're thinking of.

- [[iconic]] 

 (1) Symbolic. (2) Relating to a greatly admired and successful person or thing. 

•  The  1963  March  on  Washington  was  the  iconic  event  in  the  history  of  the  civil-rights  movement,
now familiar to all American schoolchildren. 

The original meaning of iconic was essentially “resembling an icon,” but today it more often seems to
mean “so admired that it could be the subject of an icon.” And with that meaning, iconic has become
part of the language of advertising and publicity; today companies and magazines and TV hosts are
constantly  encouraging  us  to  think  of  some  consumer  item  or  pop  star  or  show  as  first-rate  or
immortal or flawless—absolutely “iconic”—when he or she or it is actually nothing of the kind.

- [[iconoclast]] 
person who attacks settled beliefs or institutions. 

 (1) A person who destroys religious images or opposes their use. (2) A

•  She's  always  rattling  her  friends  by  saying  outrageous  things,  and  she  enjoys  her  reputation  as  an
iconoclast. 

When the early books of the Bible were being written, most of the other Middle Eastern religions had
more  than  one  god;  these  religions  generally  encouraged  the  worship  of  idols  of  the  various  gods,
which were often regarded as magical objects. But in the Ten Commandments given to Moses in the
Old Testament, God prohibits the making of “graven images” or “idols” for worship, proclaiming that
the Jews are to worship only one God, who is too great to be represented in an idol. However, by the
6th century A.D., Christians had begun to create religious images in order to focus the prayers of the
faithful. Opposition to icons led to the Iconoclastic Controversy in A.D. 726, when, supported by the
pope, iconoclasts began smashing and burning the images in churches and monasteries (clast- [[comes]]
from  the  Greek  word  meaning  “to  break”).  In  time,  peace  was  restored,  and  almost  all  Christians
have since accepted depictions of Jesus, Mary, and the saints. Today an iconoclast is someone who
constantly  argues  with  conventional  thinking,  refusing  to  “worship”  the  objects  of  everyone  else's
“faith.”

- [[iconography]] 
study of artistic symbolism. 

 (1) The imagery and symbolism of a work of art or an artist. (2) The

•  Today  scholars  pore  over  the  advertisements  in  glossy  magazines,  studying  the  iconography  for
clues to the ads' hidden meanings. 

If you saw a 17th-century painting of a man writing at a desk with a lion at his feet, would you know
you were looking at St. Jerome, translator of the Bible, who, according to legend, once pulled a thorn
from the paw of a lion, which thereafter became his devoted friend? And if a painting showed a young
woman  reclining  on  a  bed  with  a  shower  of  gold  descending  on  her,  would  you  recognize  her  as
Danaë, locked up in a tower to keep her away from the lustful Zeus, who then managed to gain access
to her by transforming himself into golden light (or golden coins)? An iconographic approach to art
can  make  museum-going  a  lot  of  fun—and  amateur  iconographers  know  there  are  also  plenty  of
symbols lurking in the images that advertisers bombard us with daily.
