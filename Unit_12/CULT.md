- CULT comes from the Latin cultus, meaning “care.” So cultivation is care of something, such as a
garden, in a way that encourages its growth. And culture is what is produced by cultivating human
knowledge, skills, beliefs, manners, science, and art over many years.

- [[acculturation]] 
  (1)  Modification  of  the  culture  of  an  individual,  group,  or
people  by  adapting  to  or  borrowing  traits  from  another  culture.  (2)  The  process  by  which  a  human
being acquires the culture of a particular society from infancy. 

•  The  old  Eastern  European  bagel  has  gone  through  an  acculturation  in  America,  where  it  has
acquired a soft texture, a white interior, and fillers like eggs and peanut butter. 

Whenever  people  come  in  close  contact  with  a  population  that's  more  powerful,  they're  generally
forced to acculturate in order to survive. Learning a new language is usually part of the acculturation
process, which may also include adopting new clothing, a new diet, new occupations, and even a new
religion. An older generation often fails to acculturate thoroughly, but their children often pick up the
new ways quickly.

- [[cross]]-cultural 
different cultures or cultural areas. 

  Dealing  with  or  offering  comparison  between  two  or  more

• A cross-cultural study of 49 tribes revealed a tight relationship between the closeness of mother-
infant bonding in a given tribe and that tribe's peacefulness toward its neighbors. 

If  you've  ever  traveled  in  a  foreign  country,  you've  found  yourself  making  some  cross-cultural
comparisons: Why are huge family dinners so much more common in Italy than back home? Why do
Mexican teenagers seem to play with their little relatives so much more than teenagers in the U.S.?
Cross-cultural  analysis  has  produced  extremely  interesting  data  about  such  things  as  the  effects  of
various  nations'  diets  on  their  populations'  health.  Though  cross-cultural  was  originally  used  by
anthropologists  to  refer  to  research  comparing  aspects  of  different  cultures,  it's  also  often  used  to
describe the reality that lots of us face daily while simply walking the streets of a big American city.

- [[horticulture]] 
ornamental plants. 

  The  science  and  art  of  growing  fruits,  vegetables,  flowers,  or

•  He  considered  majoring  in  botany,  but  has  decided  instead  on  horticulture,  hoping  he  can  spend
more time in a greenhouse than in the library or the lab. 

Hortus is Latin for “garden,” and the first gardens were planted about 10,000 years ago in what is
often called the Fertile Crescent—the crescent-shaped area stretching from Israel north through Syria
and down Iraq's two great rivers to the Persian Gulf. Probably more fertile in previous centuries than
it is today, it was the original home of such food plants as wheat, barley, peas, and lentils or their
ancient  ancestors  (not  to  mention  the  ancestors  of  cows,  pigs,  sheep,  and  goats  as  well).  Many
horticulturists today work as researchers or plant breeders or tend orchards and greenhouses—but
most American households contain at least one amateur horticulturist.

- [[subculture]] 
within a culture or society. 

 A group whose beliefs and behaviors are different from the main groups

• Members of the emo subculture at her high school recognized each other by their skinny jeans, dyed
hair, and canvas sneakers. 

This common meaning of subculture (it has an older biological meaning) only appeared in the 1930s,
and for about 20 years it was used mostly by sociologists, psychologists, and anthropologists. But in
the 1950s, as America's wealth led to more and more teenagers getting their own cars and thus their
independence, not to mention the arrival of rock 'n' roll, people noticed something unusual happening
among  young  people,  and  began  to  speak  of  the  “youth  subculture.”  As  the  country's  wealth  and
freedom of movement continued to increase, we realized that the U.S. had become home to a large
number of subcultures. Today the Web makes possible more than anyone could have dreamed of back
in  the  1950s.  When  we  happen  to  stumble  on  a  subculture—bodybuilders,  Trekkies,  hackers,
Airstreamers,  anime  lovers,  motocross  enthusiasts—we  may  realize  with  astonishment  that  we  had
never even imagined that it might exist.
