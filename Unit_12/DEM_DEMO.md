- DEM/DEMO  comes  from  the  Greek  word  meaning  “people.”  “Government  by  the  people”  was
invented by the ancient Greeks, so it's appropriate that they were the first to come up with a word for
it: demokratia, or democracy.

- [[demographic]] 
size, growth, density, and patterns of living. 

 Having to do with the study of human populations, especially their

•  Each  year  the  state  government  uses  the  most  current  demographic  figures  to  determine  how  to
distribute its funding for education. 

Demographic analysis, the statistical description of human populations, is a tool used by government
agencies,  political  parties,  and  manufacturers  of  consumer  goods.  Polls  conducted  on  every  topic
imaginable, from age to toothpaste preference, give the government and corporations an idea of who
the  public  is  and  what  it  needs  and  wants.  The  government's  census,  which  is  conducted  every  ten
years, is the largest demographic survey of all. Today demographic is also being used as a noun; so,
for example, TV advertisers are constantly worrying about how to appeal to “the 18-to-24-year-old
demographic.”

- [[endemic]] 
occupation, area, or environment. 

  (1)  Found  only  in  a  given  place  or  region.  (2)  Often  found  in  a  given

• Malaria remains endemic in tropical regions around the world. 

With its en- [[prefix]], endemic means literally “in the population.” Since the panda is found in the wild
exclusively  in  central  China  and  eastern  Tibet,  scientists  say  it's  “endemic  to”  those  areas.  But  the
word can also mean simply “common” or “typical”; so we can say that corruption is endemic in the
government of a country, that colds are “endemic in” nursery school, or that love of Barbie dolls is
“endemic  among”  young  American  girls.  Don't  confuse  endemic  with  epidemic;  something  can  be
endemic in a region for centuries without ever “exploding.”

- [[demagogue]] 
in order to arouse discontent and to advance his or her own political purposes. 

 A political leader who appeals to the emotions and prejudices of people

• His supporters called him a “man of the people”; his enemies called him a lying demagogue. 

Demagogue  was  once  defined  by  the  writer  H.  L.  Mencken  as  “one  who  will  preach  doctrines  he
knows to be untrue to men he knows to be idiots,” and Mencken's definition still works quite well.
The  “doctrines”  (ideas)  preached  by  demagogues  will  naturally  always  be  the  kind  that  appeal
directly to the ordinary voter, the “common man” or “little guy.” Appealing to the common people is
not  itself  a  bad  thing,  but  it  has  often  been  used  by  those  who  calculate  that  demagoguery  (or
demagogy) is the easiest way to power. In most countries, fear of demagogic leaders is so strong that
voters aren't even permitted to vote directly for the nation's leader, but instead vote only for a local
representative.

- [[demotic]] 

 Popular or common. 

• Partly because of television, the demotic language and accents of America's various regions have
become more and more similar. 

For many years demotic was used only to describe the writing of ancient Egypt, as the name of the
script used by ordinary Egyptians rather than by their priests. Demotic is still an intellectual word,
but it can now be used to describe any popular style in contrast to a style associated with a higher
class, especially a style of speech or writing. So, for example, demotic Californian is different from
demotic  Texan.  The  most  demotic  dress  today  is  probably  blue  jeans  and  sneakers,  and  those  who
wear them have demotic taste in fashion. The problem is, in American society it can sometimes be
hard to find a style that can't be described as demotic.

- POPUL comes from the Latin word meaning “people,” and in fact forms the basis of the word people
