- THE/THEO  comes  from  the  Greek  word  meaning  “god.”  Theology,  the  study  of  religion,  is
practiced  by  theologians.  Monotheism  is  the  worship  of  a  single  god;  Christianity,  Islam,  and
Judaism are monotheistic religions, and all three worship the same god. Polytheistic religions such
as those of ancient Greece and Rome, on the other hand, worship many gods.

- [[apotheosis]] 

 (1) Transformation into a god. (2) The perfect example. 

• Abraham Lincoln's apotheosis after his assassination transformed the controversial politician into
the saintly savior of his country. 

In ancient Greece, historical figures were sometimes worshipped as gods. In Rome, apotheosis was
rare  until  the  emperor  Augustus  declared  the  dead  Julius  Caesar  to  be  a  god,  and  soon  other  dead
emperors  were  being  apotheosized  as  well.  In  older  paintings  you  may  see  a  heroic  figure—
Napoleon,  George  Washington,  or  Shakespeare,  for  example—being  raised  into  the  clouds,
symbolizing his or her apotheosis. But today any great classic example of something can be called its
apotheosis.  You  might  hear  it  said,  for  example,  that  Baroque  music  reached  its  apotheosis  in  the
works of J. S. Bach, or that the Duesenberg Phaeton was the apotheosis of the touring car.

- [[atheistic]] 

 Denying the existence of God or divine power. 

•  The  atheistic  Madalyn  Murray  O'Hair  successfully  sought  the  removal  of  prayer  from  American
public schools in the 1960s. 

In the Roman Empire, early Christians were called atheistic because they denied the existence of the
Roman  gods.  And  once  the  Christian  church  was  firmly  established,  it  condemned  the  Romans  as
atheists  because  they  didn't  believe  in  the  Christian  God.  In  later  centuries,  English-speaking
Christians  would  often  use  the  words  pagan  and  heathen  to  describe  such  non-Christians,  while
atheist  would  be  reserved  for  those  who  actually  denied  the  existence  of  any  god.  Atheism  is
different from agnosticism, which claims that the existence of any higher power is unknowable; and
lots of people who simply don't think much about religion often call themselves agnostics as well.

- [[pantheon]] 
famous dead of a nation. (2) A group of notable persons or things. 

 (1) A building serving as the burial place of or containing memorials to the

• A Hall of Fame serves as a kind of pantheon for its field, and those admitted in the early years are
often the greatest of all. 

Each of the important Roman gods and goddesses had many temples erected in their name. But in 27
B.C.  a  temple  to  all  the  gods  together  was  completed  in  Rome;  twice  destroyed,  it  was  ultimately
replaced  by  a  third  temple  around  A.D.  126.  This  extraordinary  domed  structure  is  still  one  of  the
important sights of Rome, and the burial place for the painters Raphael and Carracci and two kings. In
Paris, a great church was completed in 1789–90; named the Panthéon, it was announced as the future
resting place of France's great figures, and the bodies of Victor Hugo, Louis Pasteur, Marie Curie, and
many others now rest within its walls.

- [[theocracy]] 
state governed by a theocracy. 

 (1) Government by officials who are regarded as divinely inspired. (2) A

• The ancient Aztecs lived in a theocracy in which guidance came directly from the gods through the
priests. 

In  the  Middle  Ages,  the  Muslim  empires  stretching  around  much  of  the  Mediterranean  were
theocracies, and the pope ruled most of modern-day Italy. But theocracies are rare today. Modern Iran
and Saudi Arabia (and perhaps half a dozen others) are usually regarded as theocratic governments,
since, even though Iran's president is elected by popular vote and Saudi Arabia is ruled by a royal
family, the countries' laws are religious laws. But when a government tries to follow all the teachings
of a single religion, things usually don't work out terribly well, so U.S. Constitution and Bill of Rights
forbid using religion as the principal basis for democracy.
