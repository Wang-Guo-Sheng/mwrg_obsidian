UMBR comes from the Latin umbra, meaning “shadow.” Thus, the familiar umbrella, with its ending
meaning “little,” casts a “little shadow” to keep off the sun or the rain.

• Van Dyke prized umber as a pigment and used it constantly in his oil paintings. 

The mineral deposits of Italy provided sources of a number of natural pigments, among them umber.
Since the late Renaissance, umber has been in great demand as a coloring agent. When crushed and
mixed  with  paint,  it  produces  an  olive  color  known  as  raw  umber;  when  crushed  and  burnt,  it
produces a darker tone known as burnt umber.

- [[adumbrate]] 

 (1) To give a sketchy outline or disclose in part. (2) To hint at or foretell. 

• The Secretary of State would only adumbrate his ideas for bringing peace to Bosnia. 

A synonym for adumbrate is foreshadow,  which  means  to  present  a  shadowy  version  of  something
before it becomes reality or is provided in full. Tough questioning by a Supreme Court justice may
adumbrate the way he or she is planning to rule on a case. A bad review by a critic may adumbrate
the failure of a new film. And rats scurrying off a ship were believed to adumbrate a coming disaster
at sea.

- [[penumbra]] 
(2) The fringe or surrounding area where something exists less fully. 

 (1) The partial shadow surrounding a complete shadow, as in an eclipse.

• This area of the investigation was the penumbra where both the FBI and the CIA wanted to pursue
their leads. 

Every solar eclipse casts an umbra, the darker central area in which almost no light reaches the earth,
and a penumbra, the area of partial shadow where part of the sun is still visible. Penumbra can thus
be used to describe any “gray area” where things aren't all black and white. For example, the right to
privacy falls under the penumbra of the U.S. Constitution; though it isn't specifically guaranteed there,
the Supreme Court has held that it is implied, and thus that the government may not intrude into certain
areas  of  a  citizen's  private  life.  Because  its  existence  is  still  shadowy,  however,  the  Court  is  still
determining how much of an individual's life is protected by the right to privacy.

• She often took umbrage at his treatment of her, without being able to pinpoint what was offensive
about it. 

An umbrage was originally a shadow, and soon the word also began to mean “a shadowy suspicion.”
Then  it  came  to  mean  “displeasure”  as  well—that  is,  a  kind  of  shadow  blocking  the  sunlight.
Umbrage is now generally used in the phrase “take umbrage at.” An overly sensitive person may take
umbrage at something as small as having his or her name pronounced wrong.
