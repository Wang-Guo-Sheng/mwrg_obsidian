•  Their  failure  to  find  help  led  to  endless  and  pointless  recriminations  over responsibility  for  the accident. 

Defending  oneself  from  a  verbal  attack  by  means  of  a  counterattack  is  as  natural  as  physical  self-defense. So a disaster often brings recriminations among those connected with it, and divorces and child-custody battles usually involve recriminations between husband and wife. An actual crime isn't
generally  involved,  but  it  may  be;  when  two  suspects  start  exchanging  angry  recriminations  after they've been picked up, it often leads to one of them turning against the other in court.
