享乐主义（本来是伊壁鸠鲁的概念，后来庸俗化为一般的感官享乐）

An attitude or way of life based on the idea that pleasure or happiness should be the chief goal. 

•  In  her  new  spirit  of  hedonism,  she  went  out  for  a  massage,  picked  up  champagne  and  chocolate truffles, and made a date that evening with an old boyfriend. 

Derived  from  the  Greek  word  for  “pleasure,”  hedonism  over  the  ages  has  provided  the  basis  for several  philosophies.  The  ancient  **Epicureans**  and  the  19th-century  **Utilitarians**  both  taught  and
pursued  hedonistic  principles.  But  although  we  generally  use  the  word  today  when  talking  about immediate pleasures for the senses, philosophers who talk about hedonism are usually talking about
quiet pleasures that aren't pursued in a selfish way.
