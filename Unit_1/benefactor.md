  Someone  who  helps  another  person  or  group,  especially  by  giving money. 

• An anonymous benefactor had given $15 million to establish an ecological institute at the university.

A benefactor may be involved in almost any field. One may endow a scholarship fund; another may
give money to expand a library; still another may leave a generous sum to a hospital in her will. The
famous  benefactions  of  John  D.  Rockefeller  included  the  gifts  that  established  the  University  of
Chicago,  the  Rockefeller  Foundation,  and  Rockefeller  University.  Many  benefactors  have  reported
that giving away their money turned out to be the most rewarding thing they ever did.
