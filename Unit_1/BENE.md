BENE is Latin for “well.” A benefit is a good result or effect. Something beneficial produces good
results  or  effects.  The  Latin  root  can  be  heard  in  other  languages  as  well:  “Good!”  or  “Fine!”  in
Spanish is “Bueno!”; in French, it's “Bon!”; and in Italian, just say “Bene!”

  A  prayer  that  asks  for  God's  blessing,  especially  a  prayer  that

• The moment the bishop had finished his benediction, she squeezed quickly out of her row and darted
out the cathedral's side entrance. 

In benediction, the bene root is joined by another Latin root, dictio, “speaking” (see DICT), so the
word's meaning becomes something like “well-wishing.” Perhaps the best-known benediction is the
so-called Aaronic Benediction from the Bible, which begins, “May the Lord bless you and keep you.”
An important section of the Catholic Mass was traditionally known as the Benedictus, after its first
word (meaning “blessed”). It was St. Benedict who organized the first Christian monasteries; many
Christians have been baptized Benedict in his honor, and 16 popes have taken it as their papal name.

• An anonymous benefactor had given $15 million to establish an ecological institute at the university.

A benefactor may be involved in almost any field. One may endow a scholarship fund; another may
give money to expand a library; still another may leave a generous sum to a hospital in her will. The
famous  benefactions  of  John  D.  Rockefeller  included  the  gifts  that  established  the  University  of
Chicago,  the  Rockefeller  Foundation,  and  Rockefeller  University.  Many  benefactors  have  reported
that giving away their money turned out to be the most rewarding thing they ever did.

- [[beneficiary]] 
from something, especially one that receives money or property when someone dies. 

 A person or organization that benefits or is expected to benefit

• Living in a trailer in near-poverty, she received word in the mail that her father had died, naming her
as the sole beneficiary of his life-insurance policy. 

Beneficiary is often used in connection with life insurance, but it shows up in many other contexts as
well. A college may be the beneficiary of a private donation. Your uncle's will may make a church his
sole beneficiary, in which case all his money and property will go to it when he dies. A “third-party
beneficiary” of a contract is a person (often a child) who the people signing the contract (which is
usually an insurance policy or an employee-benefit plan) want to benefit from it. In a more general
way,  a  small  business  may  be  a  beneficiary  of  changes  to  the  tax  code,  or  a  restaurant  may  be  the
beneficiary when the one across the street closes down and its whole lunch crowd starts coming in.

- [[benevolence]] 

 Kindness, generosity. 

•  In  those  financially  desperate  years,  the  young  couple  was  saved  only  by  the  benevolence  of  her
elderly great-uncle. 

Part of benevolence comes from the Latin root meaning “wish.” The novels of Charles Dickens often
include a benevolent figure who rescues the main characters at some point—Mr. Brownlow in Oliver
Twist, Abel Magwitch in David Copperfield, Mr. Jarndyce in Bleak House, Ebenezer Scrooge in A
Christmas Carol. To be benevolent, it helps to have money, but it's not necessary; kind assistance of a
nonfinancial sort may turn out to be lifesaving benevolence as well.

- AM  comes  from  the  Latin  amare,  “to  love.”  The  Roman  god  of  love  was  known  by  two  different
