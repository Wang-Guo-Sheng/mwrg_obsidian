严峻的；严肃的，正式的
  (1)  Requiring  serious  thought  or  concern.  (2)  Serious  and  formal  in  appearance  or manner.

• We realized that the situation was grave and that the slightest incident could spark all-out war. 

Gravity  has  a  familiar  physical  meaning  but  also  a  nonphysical  meaning—basically  “seriousness.”
Thus, something grave  possesses  gravity.  You  can  refer  to  the  gravity  of  a  person's  manner,  though public figures today seem to have a lot less gravity than they used to have. Or you can talk about a grave situation, as in the example sentence. But even though Shakespeare makes a pun on grave when
a dying character talks about being buried the next day (“Ask for me tomorrow and you shall find me a grave man”), the word meaning “hole for burying a body” isn't actually related.
