战前（《飘》的怀旧，二战后欧洲的衰颓）
Existing  before  a  war,  especially  before  the  American  Civil  War (1861–65). 

• When World War I was over, the French nobility found it impossible to return to their extravagant antebellum way of life. 

Even countries that win a war often end up worse off than they had been before, and the losers almost always  do.  So  antebellum  often  summons  up  images  of  ease,  elegance,  and  entertainment  that
disappeared in the postwar years. In the American South, the antebellum way of life depended on a social structure, based on slavery, that collapsed after the Civil War; Margaret Mitchell's Gone with the Wind shows the nostalgia and bitterness felt by wealthy Southerners after the war more than the relief and anticipation experienced by those released from slavery. In Europe, World War I shattered the grand life of the upper classes, even in victorious France and Britain, and changed society hugely in the space of just four years.
