安抚；平定（镇压）
 (1) To soothe anger or agitation. (2) To subdue by armed action. 

• It took the police hours to pacify the angry demonstrators. 

Someone stirred up by a strong emotion can usually be pacified by some kind words and the removal of its causes. Unhappy babies are often given a rubber pacifier for sucking to make them stop crying.
During  the  Vietnam  War,  pacification  of  an  area  meant  using  armed  force  to  drive  out  the  enemy, which  might  be  followed  by  bringing  the  local  people  over  to  our  side  by  building  schools  and providing  social  services.  But  an  army  can  often  bring  “peace”  by  pure  force,  without  soothing
anyone's emotions.
