受益人
 A person or organization that benefits or is expected to benefit
from something, especially one that receives money or property when someone dies. 

• Living in a trailer in near-poverty, she received word in the mail that her father had died, naming her
as the sole beneficiary of his life-insurance policy. 

Beneficiary is often used in connection with life insurance, but it shows up in many other contexts as
well. A college may be the beneficiary of a private donation. Your uncle's will may make a church his
sole beneficiary, in which case all his money and property will go to it when he dies. A “third-party
beneficiary” of a contract is a person (often a child) who the people signing the contract (which is
usually an insurance policy or an employee-benefit plan) want to benefit from it. In a more general
way,  a  small  business  may  be  a  beneficiary  of  changes  to  the  tax  code,  or  a  restaurant  may  be  the
beneficiary when the one across the street closes down and its whole lunch crowd starts coming in.
