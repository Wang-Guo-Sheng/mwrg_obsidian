 A long piece of wood, metal, etc., that sticks out from a wall to support something above it. 

•  The  house's  deck,  supported  by  cantilevers,  jutted  out  dramatically  over  the  rocky  slope,  and looking over the edge made him dizzy. 

Cantilevers hold up a surface or room without themselves being supported at their outer end. 
Many outdoor **balconies** are cantilevered, and theater balconies may be as well.
A **cantilevered bridge** may have  a  huge  span  (as  long  as  1,800  feet)  built  out  on  either  side  of  a  single  large  foundation  pier.
Architects sometimes use cantilevered construction to produce dramatic effects; Frank Lloyd Wright's “Fallingwater”  house,  which  extends  out  over  a  rocky  river,  is  a  famous  example.  But  the  Grand
Canyon's  “Skywalk”  has  become  perhaps  the  best-known  piece  of  cantilevered  construction  in America.
