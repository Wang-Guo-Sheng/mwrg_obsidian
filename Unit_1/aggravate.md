(1) To make (an injury, problem, etc.) more serious or severe. 
(2) To annoy or bother. 

•  She  went  back  to  the  soccer  team  before  the  knee  was  completely  healed,  which  naturally aggravated the injury. 

Since the grav- root means basically “weighty or serious,” the original meaning of aggravate was “to make more serious.” A bad relationship with your parents can be aggravated by marrying someone
who  nobody  likes,  for  example,  or  a  touchy  trade  relationship  between  two  countries  can  be aggravated  by  their  inability  to  agree  on  climate-change  issues.  Depression  can  be  aggravated  by
insomnia—and  insomnia  can  be  aggravated  by  depression.  But  when  most  people  use  aggravate today, they employ its “annoy” sense, as in “What really aggravates my dad is having to listen to that TV all day long.”
