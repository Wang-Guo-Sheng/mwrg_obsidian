This word looks like another that is much more familiar, but notice how it's pronounced. It is used only  by  intellectuals,  and  often  printed  in  italics  so  that  the  reader  doesn't  mistake  it  for  the  other

peace? Because it says “Peace to them (that is, to the people I'm mentioning)—I don't want to start an argument; I just want to correct the facts.”
