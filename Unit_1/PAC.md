- PAC is related to the Latin words for “agree” and “peace.” The Pacific Ocean—that is, the “Peaceful
Ocean”—was named by Ferdinand Magellan because it seemed so calm after he had sailed through
the storms near Cape Horn. (Magellan obviously had never witnessed a Pacific typhoon.)

- [[pacify]] 

 (1) To soothe anger or agitation. (2) To subdue by armed action. 

• It took the police hours to pacify the angry demonstrators. 

Someone stirred up by a strong emotion can usually be pacified by some kind words and the removal
of its causes. Unhappy babies are often given a rubber pacifier for sucking to make them stop crying.
During  the  Vietnam  War,  pacification  of  an  area  meant  using  armed  force  to  drive  out  the  enemy,
which  might  be  followed  by  bringing  the  local  people  over  to  our  side  by  building  schools  and
providing  social  services.  But  an  army  can  often  bring  “peace”  by  pure  force,  without  soothing
anyone's emotions.

- [[pacifist]] 
arms or to fight, on moral or religious grounds. 

 A person opposed to war or violence, especially someone who refuses to bear

•  Her  grandfather  had  fought  in  the  Marines  in  World  War  II,  but  in  his  later  years  he  had  become
almost a pacifist, opposing every war for one reason or another. 

The Quakers and the Jehovah's Witnesses are pacifist religious groups, and Henry David Thoreau and
Martin  Luther  King  are  probably  the  most  famous  American  pacifists.  Like  these  groups  and
individuals, pacifists haven't always met with sympathy or understanding. Refusing to fight ever, for
any reason, calls for strong faith in one's own moral or religious convictions, since pacifism during
wartime has often gotten people persecuted and even thrown in prison.

- [[pact]] 
between nations to deal with a problem or to resolve a dispute. 

  An  agreement  between  two  or  more  people  or  groups;  a  treaty  or  formal  agreement

• The girls made a pact never to reveal what had happened on that terrifying night in the abandoned
house. 

Pact has “peace” at its root because a pact often ends a period of unfriendly relations. The word is
generally used in the field of international relations, where diplomats may speak of an “arms pact,” a
“trade pact,” or a “fishing-rights pact.” But it may also be used for any solemn agreement or promise
between two people; after all, whenever two parties shake hands on a deal, they're not about to go to
war with each other.

- [[pace]] 

 Contrary to the opinion of. 

• She had only three husbands, pace some Hollywood historians who claim she had as many as six. 

This word looks like another that is much more familiar, but notice how it's pronounced. It is used
only  by  intellectuals,  and  often  printed  in  italics  so  that  the  reader  doesn't  mistake  it  for  the  other
word. Writers use it when correcting an opinion that many people believe; for example, “The costs of
the program, pace some commentators, will not be significant.” So what does pace have to do with
peace? Because it says “Peace to them (that is, to the people I'm mentioning)—I don't want to start an
argument; I just want to correct the facts.”
