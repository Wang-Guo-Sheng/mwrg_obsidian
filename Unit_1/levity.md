升力（假想的相对于引力的力）
轻浮轻佻

Lack of appropriate seriousness. 

•  The  Puritan  elders  tried  to  ban  levity  of  all  sorts  from  the  community's  meetings,  but  found  it increasingly difficult to control the younger generation. 

Levity originally was thought to be a physical force exactly like gravity but pulling in the opposite direction, like the helium in a balloon. As recently as the 19th century, scientists were still arguing about  its  existence.  Today  levity  refers  only  to  lightness  in  manner.  To  stern  believers  of  some religious faiths, levity is often regarded as almost sinful. But the word, like its synonym frivolity, now has an old-fashioned ring to it and is usually used only *half*-seriously.
