响亮，洪钟般的
 Extremely loud, often with especially deep richness of sound. 

•  Even  without  a  microphone,  his  stentorian  voice  was  clearly  audible  in  the  last  rows  of  the auditorium. 

Stentor, like Hector, was a warrior in the Iliad, but on the Greek side. His unusually powerful voice (Homer  calls  him  “brazen-voiced”—that  is,  with  a  voice  like  a  brass  instrument)  made  him  the natural choice for delivering announcements and proclamations to the assembled Greek army, in an era when there was no way of artificially increasing the volume of a voice.
