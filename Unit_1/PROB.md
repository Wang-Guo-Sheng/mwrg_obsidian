- PROB comes from the Latin words for “prove or proof” and “honesty or integrity.” A probe, whether
it's a little object for testing electrical circuits or a spacecraft headed for Mars, is basically something
that's looking for evidence or proof. And probable originally described something that wasn't certain
but might be “provable.”

- [[approbation]] 
pleasure or enthusiasm. 

  A  formal  or  official  act  of  approving;  praise,  usually  given  with

• The senate signaled its approbation of the new plan by voting for it unanimously. 

Approbation is a noun form of approve, but approbation is usually stronger than mere approval. An
official commendation for bravery is an example of approbation; getting reelected to office by a wide
margin  indicates  public  approbation;  and  the  social  approbation  received  by  a  star  quarterback  in
high school usually makes all the pain worthwhile.

- [[probate]] 
and of administering the estate of a dead person. 

 The process of proving in court that the will of someone who has died is valid,

• When her father died, she thought she would be able to avoid probate, but she wasn't that lucky. 

Ever since people have written wills, those wills have had to be proven genuine by a judge. Without
a  probate  process,  greedy  acquaintances  or  relatives  could  write  up  a  fake  will  stating  that  all  the
person's wealth belonged to them. To establish a will as genuine, it must generally be witnessed and
stamped by someone officially licensed to do so (though wills have sometimes been approved even
when  they  were  just  written  on  a  piece  of  scrap  paper,  with  no  witnesses).  Today  we  use  probate
more  broadly  to  mean  everything  that's  handled  in  probate court,  a  special  court  that  oversees  the
handling  of  estates  (the  money  and  property  left  when  someone  dies),  making  sure  that  everyone
eventually receives what is properly theirs.

- [[probity]] 

 Absolute honesty and uprightness. 

• Her unquestioned probity helped win her the respect of her fellow judges. 

Probity  is  a  quality  the  public  generally  hopes  for  in  its  elected  officials  but  doesn't  always  get.
Bankers, for example, have traditionally been careful to project an air of probity, even though banking
scandals  and  bailouts  have  made  this  harder  than  ever.  An  aura  of  probity  surrounds  such  public
figures  as  Warren  Buffett  and  Bill  Moyers,  men  to  whom  many  Americans  would  entrust  their
children and their finances.

- [[reprobate]] 

 A person of thoroughly bad character. 

• His wife finally left him, claiming he was a reprobate who would disappear for weeks at a time,
gambling and drinking away all his money. 

The  related  verb  of  reprobate  is  reprove,  which  originally,  as  the  opposite  of  approve,  meant  “to
condemn.” Thus, a reprobate, as the word was used in Biblical translations, was someone condemned
to hell. But for many years reprobate has been said in a tone of joshing affection, usually to describe
someone  of  doubtful  morals  but  good  humor.  Shakespeare's  great  character  Falstaff—a  lazy,  lying,
boastful, sponging drunkard—is the model of a reprobate, but still everyone's favorite Shakespeare
character.
