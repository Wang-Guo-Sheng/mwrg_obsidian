热恋的，（讽刺）干柴烈火
 Having or showing strong feelings of attraction or love. 

• It turned out that the amorous Congressman had gotten his girlfriend a good job and was paying for her apartment. 

A couple smooching on a park bench could be called amorous, or a young married couple who are always  hugging  and  kissing.  But  the  word  is  often  used  a  bit  sarcastically,  as  when  a  tabloid newspaper gets hold of some scandalous photos and calls the participants “the amorous pair.” In such
cases, we may be encouraged to think the attraction is more physical than emotional.
