和平主义者
 A person opposed to war or violence, especially someone who refuses to bear arms or to fight, on moral or religious grounds. 

•  Her  grandfather  had  fought  in  the  Marines  in  World  War  II,  but  in  his  later  years  he  had  become almost a pacifist, opposing every war for one reason or another. 

The Quakers and the Jehovah's Witnesses are pacifist religious groups, and Henry David Thoreau and Martin  Luther  King  are  probably  the  most  famous  American  pacifists.  Like  these  groups  and
individuals, pacifists haven't always met with sympathy or understanding. Refusing to fight ever, for any reason, calls for strong faith in one's own moral or religious convictions, since pacifism during wartime has often gotten people persecuted and even thrown in prison.
