好战的军国主义者，主战派

 Warlike, aggressive, quarrelsome. 

• The more bellicose party always got elected whenever there was tension along the border and the public believed that military action would lead to security. 

Since  bellicose  describes  an  attitude  that  hopes  for  actual  war,  the  word  is  generally  applied  to nations  and  their  leaders.  In  the  20th  century,  it  was  commonly  used  to  describe  such  figures  as Germany's Kaiser Wilhelm, Italy's Benito Mussolini, and Japan's General Tojo, leaders who believed their countries had everything to gain by starting wars. The international relations of a nation with a bellicose foreign policy tend to be stormy and difficult, and bellicosity usually makes the rest of the
world very uneasy.
