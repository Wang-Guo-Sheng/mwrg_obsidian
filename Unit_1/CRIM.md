- CRIM comes from the Latin words for “fault or crime” or “accusation.” It's obvious where the root
shows  up  most  commonly  in  English.  A  crime  is  an  act  forbidden  by  the  government,  which  the
government  itself  will  punish  you  for,  and  for  which  you  may  be  branded  a  criminal.  A  crime  is
usually  more  serious  than  a  tort (see TORT),  a  “civil  wrong”  for  which  the  wronged  person  must
himself sue if he wants to get repaid in some way.

- [[criminology]] 

 The study of crime, criminals, law enforcement, and punishment. 

• His growing interest in criminology led him to become a probation officer. 

Criminology  includes  the  study  of  all  aspects  of  crime  and  law  enforcement—criminal  psychology,
the  social  setting  of  crime,  prohibition  and  prevention,  investigation  and  detection,  capture  and
punishment.  Thus,  many  of  the  people  involved—legislators,  social  workers,  probation  officers,
judges,  etc.—could  possibly  be  considered  criminologists,  though  the  word  usually  refers  only  to
scholars and researchers.

- [[decriminalize]] 

 To remove or reduce the criminal status of. 

• An angry debate over decriminalizing doctor-assisted suicide raged all day in the statehouse. 

Decriminalization  of  various  “victimless  crimes”—crimes  that  don't  directly  harm  others,  such  as
private gambling and drug-taking—has been recommended by conservatives as well as liberals, who
often claim that it would ease the burden on the legal system, decrease the amount of money flowing
to  criminals,  and  increase  personal  liberty.  Decriminalization  is  not  the  same  as  legalization;
decriminalization may still call for a small fine (like a traffic ticket), and may apply only to use or
possession of something, leaving the actual sale of goods or services illegal.

- [[incriminate]] 

 To show evidence of involvement in a crime or a fault. 

• The muddy tracks leading to and from the cookie jar were enough to incriminate them. 

Testimony  may  incriminate  a  suspect  by  placing  him  at  the  scene  of  a  crime,  and  incriminating
evidence is the kind that strongly links him to it. But the word doesn't always refer to an actual crime.
We can say, for instance, that a virus has been incriminated as the cause of a type of cancer, or that
video games have been incriminated in the decline in study skills among young people.

- [[recrimination]] 
oneself. (2) The making of such an accusation. 

  (1)  An  accusation  in  answer  to  an  accusation  made  against

•  Their  failure  to  find  help  led  to  endless  and  pointless  recriminations  over  responsibility  for  the
accident. 

Defending  oneself  from  a  verbal  attack  by  means  of  a  counterattack  is  as  natural  as  physical  self-
defense. So a disaster often brings recriminations among those connected with it, and divorces and
child-custody battles usually involve recriminations between husband and wife. An actual crime isn't
generally  involved,  but  it  may  be;  when  two  suspects  start  exchanging  angry  recriminations  after
they've been picked up, it often leads to one of them turning against the other in court.

- PROB comes from the Latin words for “prove or proof” and “honesty or integrity.” A probe, whether
