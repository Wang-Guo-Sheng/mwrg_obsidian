遗嘱认证（法庭）

 The process of proving in court that the will of someone who has died is valid, and of administering the estate of a dead person. 

• When her father died, she thought she would be able to avoid probate, but she wasn't that lucky. 

Ever since people have written wills, those wills have had to be proven genuine by a judge. Without a  probate  process,  greedy  acquaintances  or  relatives  could  write  up  a  fake  will  stating  that  all  the person's wealth belonged to them. To establish a will as genuine, it must generally be witnessed and stamped by someone officially licensed to do so (though wills have sometimes been approved even when  they  were  just  written  on  a  piece  of  scrap  paper,  with  no  witnesses).  Today  we  use  probate
more  broadly  to  mean  everything  that's  handled  in  probate court,  a  special  court  that  oversees  the handling  of  estates  (the  money  and  property  left  when  someone  dies),  making  sure  that  everyone
eventually receives what is properly theirs.
