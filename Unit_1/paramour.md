情人或者偷情对象
 A lover, often secret, not allowed by law or custom. 

• He had been coming to the house for two years before her brothers realized that he was actually the paramour of their shy and withdrawn sister. 

Paramour came to English from French (a language based on Latin), though the modern French don't use the word. Since par amour meant “through love,” it implies a relationship based solely on love, often physical love, rather than on social custom or ceremony. So today it tends to refer to the lover of a married man or woman, but may be used for any lover who isn't obeying the social rules.
