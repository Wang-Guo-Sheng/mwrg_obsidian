炽热地爱上
 Charmed or fascinated; inflamed with love. 

•  Rebecca  quickly  became  enamored  of  the  town's  rustic  surroundings,  its  slow  pace,  and  its eccentric characters. 

Computer hackers are always enamored of their new programs and games. Millions of readers have
found themselves enamored with Jane Austen's novels. And Romeo and Juliet were, of course, utterly
enamored of each other. But we also often use the word in negative contexts: A friend at work may
complain that she's not enamored of the new boss, and when you start talking about how you're not
enamored with the neighbors it may be time to move. (Note that both of and with are commonly used
after enamored.)
