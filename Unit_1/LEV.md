- LEV comes from the Latin adjective levis, meaning “light,” and the verb levare, meaning “to raise or
lighten.”  So  a  lever  is  a  bar  used  to  lift  something,  by  means  of  leverage.  And  levitation  is  the
magician's trick in which a body seems to rise into the air by itself.

- [[alleviate]] 

 To lighten, lessen, or relieve, especially physical or mental suffering. 

• Cold compresses alleviated the pain of the physical injury, but only time could alleviate the effect of
the insult. 

Physical pain or emotional anguish, or a water shortage or traffic congestion, can all be alleviated by
providing the appropriate remedy. But some pain or anguish or shortage or congestion will remain: to
alleviate is not to cure.

- [[elevation]] 
someone or something. 

  (1)  The  height  of  a  place.  (2)  The  act  or  result  of  lifting  or  raising

• Her doctor is concerned about the elevation of her blood pressure since her last visit. 

When  you're  hiking,  you  may  be  interested  in  knowing  the  highest  elevation  you'll  be  reaching.
Psychologists  use  the  term  “mood  elevation”  to  mean  improvement  in  a  patient's  depression,  and
some leg ailments require elevation of the limb, usually so that it's higher than the heart for part of
each day. Elevation can also mean “promotion”; thus, a vice president may be elevated to president,
or a captain may be elevated to admiral.

- [[cantilever]] 
something above it. 

 A long piece of wood, metal, etc., that sticks out from a wall to support

•  The  house's  deck,  supported  by  cantilevers,  jutted  out  dramatically  over  the  rocky  slope,  and
looking over the edge made him dizzy. 

Cantilevers hold up a surface or room without themselves being supported at their outer end. Many
outdoor balconies are cantilevered, and theater balconies may be as well. A cantilevered bridge may
have  a  huge  span  (as  long  as  1,800  feet)  built  out  on  either  side  of  a  single  large  foundation  pier.
Architects sometimes use cantilevered construction to produce dramatic effects; Frank Lloyd Wright's
“Fallingwater”  house,  which  extends  out  over  a  rocky  river,  is  a  famous  example.  But  the  Grand
Canyon's  “Skywalk”  has  become  perhaps  the  best-known  piece  of  cantilevered  construction  in
America.

- [[levity]] 

 Lack of appropriate seriousness. 

•  The  Puritan  elders  tried  to  ban  levity  of  all  sorts  from  the  community's  meetings,  but  found  it
increasingly difficult to control the younger generation. 

Levity originally was thought to be a physical force exactly like gravity but pulling in the opposite
direction, like the helium in a balloon. As recently as the 19th century, scientists were still arguing
about  its  existence.  Today  levity  refers  only  to  lightness  in  manner.  To  stern  believers  of  some
religious faiths, levity is often regarded as almost sinful. But the word, like its synonym frivolity, now
has an old-fashioned ring to it and is usually used only half-seriously.

- Words from Mythology and History

cicerone 
architectural sites and explains what is being seen. 

  A  guide,  especially  one  who  takes  tourists  to  museums,  monuments,  or

•  On  Crete  they  sought  out  a  highly  recommended  cicerone,  hoping  to  receive  the  best  possible
introduction to the noteworthy historical sites. 

The Roman statesman and orator Cicero was renowned for his elegant style and great knowledge (and
occasional long-windedness). So 18th-century Italians seem to have given the name cicerone to the
guides who would show well-educated foreigners around the great cultural sites of the ancient Roman
empire—guides  who  sought  to  be  as  eloquent  and  informed  as  Cicero  in  explaining  the  world  in
which he lived.

- [[hector]] 

 To bully or harass by bluster or personal pressure. 

•  He  would  swagger  around  the  apartment  entrance  with  his  friends  and  hector  the  terrified
inhabitants going in and out. 

In Homer's great Iliad, Hector was the leader of the Trojan forces, and the very model of nobility and
honor. In the Greek war against Troy, he killed several great warriors before being slain by Achilles.
His name began to take on its current meaning only after gangs of bullying young rowdies, many of
them armed soldiers recently released from service following the end of the English Civil War, began
terrorizing the residents of late-17th-century London. The gangs took such names as the Roysters, the
Blades,  the  Bucks,  and  the  Bloods,  but  the  best-known  of  them  was  called  the  Hectors.  The  names
Blades  and  Hectors  may  have  seemed  appropriate  because,  like  Hector  and  Achilles,  they  often
fought with swords.

- [[hedonism]] 
should be the chief goal. 

 An attitude or way of life based on the idea that pleasure or happiness

•  In  her  new  spirit  of  hedonism,  she  went  out  for  a  massage,  picked  up  champagne  and  chocolate
truffles, and made a date that evening with an old boyfriend. 

Derived  from  the  Greek  word  for  “pleasure,”  hedonism  over  the  ages  has  provided  the  basis  for
several  philosophies.  The  ancient  Epicureans  and  the  19th-century  Utilitarians  both  taught  and
pursued  hedonistic  principles.  But  although  we  generally  use  the  word  today  when  talking  about
immediate pleasures for the senses, philosophers who talk about hedonism are usually talking about
quiet pleasures that aren't pursued in a selfish way.

- [[nestor]] 

 A senior figure or leader in one's field. 

• The guest of honor was a nestor among journalists, and after dinner he shared some of his wisdom
with the audience. 

Nestor was another character from the Iliad, the eldest of the Greek leaders in the Trojan War. A great
warrior  as  a  young  man,  he  was  now  noted  for  his  wisdom  and  his  talkativeness,  both  of  which
increased  as  he  aged.  These  days,  a  nestor  is  not  necessarily  long-winded,  but  merely  wise  and
generous with his advice.

- [[spartan]] 
self-denial. 

  Marked  by  simplicity,  avoidance  of  luxury,  and  often  strict  self-discipline  or

• When he was single, he had lived a spartan life in a tiny, undecorated apartment with one chair, a
table, and a bed. 

In ancient times, the Greek city-state of Sparta had a reputation for the severe and highly disciplined
way  of  life  it  enforced  among  its  citizens,  so  as  to  keep  them  ready  for  war  at  any  time.  Physical
training  was  required  for  both  men  and  women.  A  boy  would  begin  his  military  training  at  7  and
would live in army barracks for much of his life, even after he was married. Today, when a cargo ship
or  a  remote  beach  resort  offers  “spartan  accommodations,”  some  tourists  jump  at  the  chance  for  a
refreshing change from the luxuries they've been used to—and no one worries that they'll be forced
out of bed at dawn to participate in war games.

- [[stentorian]] 

 Extremely loud, often with especially deep richness of sound. 

•  Even  without  a  microphone,  his  stentorian  voice  was  clearly  audible  in  the  last  rows  of  the
auditorium. 

Stentor, like Hector, was a warrior in the Iliad, but on the Greek side. His unusually powerful voice
(Homer  calls  him  “brazen-voiced”—that  is,  with  a  voice  like  a  brass  instrument)  made  him  the
natural choice for delivering announcements and proclamations to the assembled Greek army, in an
era when there was no way of artificially increasing the volume of a voice.

- [[stoic]] 

 Seemingly indifferent to pleasure or pain. 

• She bore the pain of her broken leg with such stoic patience that most of us had no idea she was
suffering. 

The Stoics  were  members  of  a  philosophical  movement  that  first  appeared  in  ancient  Greece  and
lasted well into the Roman era. Stoicism taught that humans should seek to free themselves from joy,
grief,  and  passions  of  all  kinds  in  order  to  attain  wisdom;  its  teachings  thus  have  much  in  common
with  Buddhism.  The  great  Stoics  include  the  statesman  Cicero,  the  playwright  Seneca,  and  the
emperor Marcus Aurelius, whose Meditations is the most famous book of Stoic philosophy. Today
we admire the kind of stoicism that enables some people (who may never have even heard of Marcus
Aurelius) to endure both mental and physical pain without complaint.

- [[sybaritic]] 

 Marked by a luxurious or sensual way of life. 

• When I knew them they were living a sybaritic existence—hopping from resort to resort, each more
splendid than the last—but a year later the money ran out. 

The ancient city of Sybaris (near modern Terranova di Sibari), founded by the Greeks on the toe of
Italy's  “boot,”  was  famous  for  the  wealth  and  luxury  of  its  citizens  in  the  6th  century  B.C.  But  the
Sybarites' wealth made them overconfident, and when they went to war with a nearby city, they were
defeated  by  a  much  smaller  army.  After  the  victory,  their  enemies  diverted  the  course  of  the  river
running through Sybaris so that it destroyed the whole city forever.
