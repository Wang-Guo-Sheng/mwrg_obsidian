（有智慧、善提建议的）老前辈、领军人物
A senior figure or leader in one's field. 

• The guest of honor was a nestor among journalists, and after dinner he shared some of his wisdom with the audience. 

Nestor was another character from the Iliad, the **eldest** of the Greek **leaders** in the Trojan War. A great warrior  as  a  young  man,  he  was  now  noted  for  his  **wisdom**  and  his  **talkativeness**,  both  of  which increased  as  he  aged.  These  days,  a  nestor  is  not  necessarily  long-winded,  but  merely  wise  and generous with his **advice**.
