Amicable often describes relations between two groups, or especially two nations—for example, the
United States and Canada, which are proud of sharing the longest unguarded border in the world. So
we  often  speak  of  an  amicable  meeting  or  an  amicable  settlement.  When  amicable  describes  more
personal relations, it may indicate a rather formal friendliness. But it's always nice when two friends
who've been quarreling manage to have an amicable conversation and to say amicable good-byes at
the end.
