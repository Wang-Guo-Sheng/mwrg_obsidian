仁和
 Kindness, generosity. 

•  In  those  financially  desperate  years,  the  young  couple  was  saved  only  by  the  benevolence  of  her
elderly great-uncle. 

Part of benevolence comes from the Latin root meaning “wish.” The novels of Charles Dickens often
include a benevolent figure who rescues the main characters at some point—Mr. Brownlow in Oliver
Twist, Abel Magwitch in David Copperfield, Mr. Jarndyce in Bleak House, Ebenezer Scrooge in A
Christmas Carol. To be benevolent, it helps to have money, but it's not necessary; kind assistance of a
nonfinancial sort may turn out to be lifesaving benevolence as well.
