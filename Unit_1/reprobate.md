恶人，要下地狱的人；小坏蛋

A person of thoroughly bad character. 

• His wife finally left him, claiming he was a reprobate who would disappear for weeks at a time, gambling and drinking away all his money. 

The  related  verb  of  reprobate  is  [[reprove]],  which  originally,  as  the  opposite  of  approve,  meant  “to condemn.” Thus, a reprobate, as the word was used in Biblical translations, was someone condemned to hell. But for many years reprobate has been said in a tone of [[joshing]] affection, usually to describe someone  of  doubtful  morals  but  good  humor.  Shakespeare's  great  character  Falstaff—a  lazy,  lying, boastful, sponging drunkard—is the model of a reprobate, but still everyone's favorite Shakespeare character.
