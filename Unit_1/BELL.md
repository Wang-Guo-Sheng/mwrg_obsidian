- BELL comes from the Latin word meaning “war.” Bellona was the little-known Roman goddess of
war; her husband, Mars, was the god of war.

- [[antebellum]] 
(1861–65). 

  Existing  before  a  war,  especially  before  the  American  Civil  War

• When World War I was over, the French nobility found it impossible to return to their extravagant
antebellum way of life. 

Even countries that win a war often end up worse off than they had been before, and the losers almost
always  do.  So  antebellum  often  summons  up  images  of  ease,  elegance,  and  entertainment  that
disappeared in the postwar years. In the American South, the antebellum way of life depended on a
social structure, based on slavery, that collapsed after the Civil War; Margaret Mitchell's Gone with
the Wind shows the nostalgia and bitterness felt by wealthy Southerners after the war more than the
relief and anticipation experienced by those released from slavery. In Europe, World War I shattered
the grand life of the upper classes, even in victorious France and Britain, and changed society hugely
in the space of just four years.

- [[bellicose]] 

 Warlike, aggressive, quarrelsome. 

• The more bellicose party always got elected whenever there was tension along the border and the
public believed that military action would lead to security. 

Since  bellicose  describes  an  attitude  that  hopes  for  actual  war,  the  word  is  generally  applied  to
nations  and  their  leaders.  In  the  20th  century,  it  was  commonly  used  to  describe  such  figures  as
Germany's Kaiser Wilhelm, Italy's Benito Mussolini, and Japan's General Tojo, leaders who believed
their countries had everything to gain by starting wars. The international relations of a nation with a
bellicose foreign policy tend to be stormy and difficult, and bellicosity usually makes the rest of the
world very uneasy.

- [[belligerence]] 

 Aggressiveness, combativeness. 

• The belligerence in Turner's voice told them that the warning was a serious threat. 

Unlike bellicose and bellicosity, the word belligerence can be used at every level from the personal
to the global. The belligerence of Marlon Brando's performances as the violent Stanley Kowalski in A
Streetcar Named Desire electrified the country in the 1940s and '50s. At the same time, belligerent
speeches by leaders of the Soviet Union and the United States throughout the Cold War were keeping
the  world  on  edge.  Belligerent  is  even  a  noun;  the  terrible  war  in  the  Congo  in  recent  years,  for
example, has involved seven nations as belligerents.

- [[rebellion]] 
authority. 

  Open  defiance  and  opposition,  sometimes  armed,  to  a  person  or  thing  in

• A student rebellion that afternoon in Room 13 resulted in the new substitute teacher racing out of the
building in tears. 

Plenty of teenagers rebel against their parents in all kinds of ways. But a rebellion usually involves a
group.  Armed  rebellions  are  usually  put  down  by  a  country's  armed  forces,  or  at  least  kept  from
expanding beyond a small area. The American War of Independence was first viewed by the British
as a minor rebellion that would soon run its course, but this particular rebellion led to a full-fledged
revolution—that is, the overthrow of a government. Rebellion, armed or otherwise, has often alerted
those in power that those they control are very unhappy.

- PAC is related to the Latin words for “agree” and “peace.” The Pacific Ocean—that is, the “Peaceful
