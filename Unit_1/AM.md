- AM  comes  from  the  Latin  amare,  “to  love.”  The  Roman  god  of  love  was  known  by  two  different
names,  Cupid  and  Amor.  Amiable  means  “friendly  or  good-natured,”  and  amigo  is  Spanish  for
“friend.”

- [[amicable]] 

 Friendly, peaceful. 

•  Their  relations  with  their  in-laws  were  generally  amicable,  despite  some  bickering  during  the
holidays. 

Amicable often describes relations between two groups, or especially two nations—for example, the
United States and Canada, which are proud of sharing the longest unguarded border in the world. So
we  often  speak  of  an  amicable  meeting  or  an  amicable  settlement.  When  amicable  describes  more
personal relations, it may indicate a rather formal friendliness. But it's always nice when two friends
who've been quarreling manage to have an amicable conversation and to say amicable good-byes at
the end.

- [[enamored]] 

 Charmed or fascinated; inflamed with love. 

•  Rebecca  quickly  became  enamored  of  the  town's  rustic  surroundings,  its  slow  pace,  and  its
eccentric characters. 

Computer hackers are always enamored of their new programs and games. Millions of readers have
found themselves enamored with Jane Austen's novels. And Romeo and Juliet were, of course, utterly
enamored of each other. But we also often use the word in negative contexts: A friend at work may
complain that she's not enamored of the new boss, and when you start talking about how you're not
enamored with the neighbors it may be time to move. (Note that both of and with are commonly used
after enamored.)

- [[amorous]] 

 Having or showing strong feelings of attraction or love. 

• It turned out that the amorous Congressman had gotten his girlfriend a good job and was paying for
her apartment. 

A couple smooching on a park bench could be called amorous, or a young married couple who are
always  hugging  and  kissing.  But  the  word  is  often  used  a  bit  sarcastically,  as  when  a  tabloid
newspaper gets hold of some scandalous photos and calls the participants “the amorous pair.” In such
cases, we may be encouraged to think the attraction is more physical than emotional.

- [[paramour]] 

 A lover, often secret, not allowed by law or custom. 

• He had been coming to the house for two years before her brothers realized that he was actually the
paramour of their shy and withdrawn sister. 

Paramour came to English from French (a language based on Latin), though the modern French don't
use the word. Since par amour meant “through love,” it implies a relationship based solely on love,
often physical love, rather than on social custom or ceremony. So today it tends to refer to the lover of
a married man or woman, but may be used for any lover who isn't obeying the social rules.
