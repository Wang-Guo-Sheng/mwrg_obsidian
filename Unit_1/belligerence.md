• The belligerence in Turner's voice told them that the warning was a serious threat. 

Unlike bellicose and bellicosity, the word belligerence can be used at every level from the personal to the global. The belligerence of Marlon Brando's performances as the violent Stanley Kowalski in A Streetcar Named Desire electrified the country in the 1940s and '50s. At the same time, belligerent speeches by leaders of the Soviet Union and the United States throughout the Cold War were keeping
the  world  on  edge.  Belligerent  is  even  a  noun;  the  terrible  war  in  the  Congo  in  recent  years,  for example, has involved seven nations as belligerents.
