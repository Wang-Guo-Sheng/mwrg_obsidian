缓解
 To lighten, lessen, or relieve, especially physical or mental suffering. 

• Cold compresses alleviated the pain of the physical injury, but only time could alleviate the effect of the insult. 

Physical pain or emotional anguish, or a water shortage or traffic congestion, can all be alleviated by providing the appropriate remedy. But some pain or anguish or shortage or congestion will remain: to alleviate is not to cure.
