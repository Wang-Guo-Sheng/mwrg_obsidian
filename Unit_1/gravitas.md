Noun
（胖官员）庄严，有分量

 Great or very dignified seriousness. 

• The head of the committee never failed to carry herself with the gravitas she felt was appropriate to her office. 

This word comes to us straight from Latin. Among the Romans, gravitas was thought to be essential to the character and functions of any adult (male) in authority. Even the head of a household or a low-level  official  would  strive  for  this  important  quality.  We  use  gravitas  today  to  identify  the  same
solemn  dignity  in  men  and  women,  but  it  seems  to  come  easier  in  those  who  are  over  60,  slow-moving—and a bit overweight.
