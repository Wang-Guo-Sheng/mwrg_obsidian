恐吓、骚扰，吹牛、欺凌（源自17世纪伦敦黑帮名，取自伊利亚特时期特洛伊攻击希腊的赫克托）
 To bully or harass by bluster or personal pressure. 

•  He  would  swagger  around  the  apartment  entrance  with  his  friends  and  hector  the  terrified inhabitants going in and out. 

In Homer's great Iliad, Hector was the leader of the Trojan forces, and the very model of nobility and honor. In the Greek war against Troy, he killed several great warriors before being slain by Achilles.
His name began to take on its current meaning only after gangs of bullying young rowdies, many of them armed soldiers recently released from service following the end of the English Civil War, began
terrorizing the residents of late-17th-century London. The gangs took such names as the Roysters, the Blades,  the  Bucks,  and  the  Bloods,  but  the  best-known  of  them  was  called  the  Hectors.  The  names Blades  and  Hectors  may  have  seemed  appropriate  because,  like  Hector  and  Achilles,  they  often fought with swords.
