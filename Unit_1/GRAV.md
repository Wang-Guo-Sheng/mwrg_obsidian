- GRAV  comes  from  the  Latin  word  meaning  “heavy,  weighty,  serious.”  Gravity  is,  of  course,  what
makes things heavy, and without it there wouldn't be any life on earth, since nothing would stay on
earth  at  all.  This  doesn't  stop  us  from  yelling  in  outrage  when  the  familiar  laws  of  gravity  cause
something to drop to the floor and break.

manner. 

  (1)  Requiring  serious  thought  or  concern.  (2)  Serious  and  formal  in  appearance  or

• We realized that the situation was grave and that the slightest incident could spark all-out war. 

Gravity  has  a  familiar  physical  meaning  but  also  a  nonphysical  meaning—basically  “seriousness.”
Thus, something grave  possesses  gravity.  You  can  refer  to  the  gravity  of  a  person's  manner,  though
public figures today seem to have a lot less gravity than they used to have. Or you can talk about a
grave situation, as in the example sentence. But even though Shakespeare makes a pun on grave when
a dying character talks about being buried the next day (“Ask for me tomorrow and you shall find me
a grave man”), the word meaning “hole for burying a body” isn't actually related.

- [[gravitas]] 

 Great or very dignified seriousness. 

• The head of the committee never failed to carry herself with the gravitas she felt was appropriate to
her office. 

This word comes to us straight from Latin. Among the Romans, gravitas was thought to be essential to
the character and functions of any adult (male) in authority. Even the head of a household or a low-
level  official  would  strive  for  this  important  quality.  We  use  gravitas  today  to  identify  the  same
solemn  dignity  in  men  and  women,  but  it  seems  to  come  easier  in  those  who  are  over  60,  slow-
moving—and a bit overweight.

- [[gravitate]] 
as if by an invisible force. 

 To move or be drawn toward something, especially by natural tendency or

• On hot evenings, the town's social life gravitated toward the lakefront, where you could stroll the
long piers eating ice cream or dance at the old Casino. 

To  gravitate  is  to  respond,  almost  unconsciously,  to  a  force  that  works  like  gravity  to  draw  things
steadily  to  it  as  if  by  their  own  weight.  Thus,  young  people  gravitate  toward  a  role  model,  moths
gravitate  to  a  flame,  a  conversation  might  gravitate  toward  politics,  and  everyone  at  a  party  often
gravitates to the bar.

- [[aggravate]] 
or bother. 

 (1) To make (an injury, problem, etc.) more serious or severe. (2) To annoy

•  She  went  back  to  the  soccer  team  before  the  knee  was  completely  healed,  which  naturally
aggravated the injury. 

Since the grav- [[root]] means basically “weighty or serious,” the original meaning of aggravate was “to
make more serious.” A bad relationship with your parents can be aggravated by marrying someone
who  nobody  likes,  for  example,  or  a  touchy  trade  relationship  between  two  countries  can  be
aggravated  by  their  inability  to  agree  on  climate-change  issues.  Depression  can  be  aggravated  by
insomnia—and  insomnia  can  be  aggravated  by  depression.  But  when  most  people  use  aggravate
today, they employ its “annoy” sense, as in “What really aggravates my dad is having to listen to that
TV all day long.”

- LEV comes from the Latin adjective levis, meaning “light,” and the verb levare, meaning “to raise or
