重
GRAV  comes  from  the  Latin  word  meaning  “heavy,  weighty,  serious.”  Gravity  is,  of  course,  what makes things heavy, and without it there wouldn't be any life on earth, since nothing would stay on earth  at  all.  This  doesn't  stop  us  from  yelling  in  outrage  when  the  familiar  laws  of  gravity  cause something to drop to the floor and break.
