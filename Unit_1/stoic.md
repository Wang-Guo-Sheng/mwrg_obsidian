The Stoics  were  members  of  a  philosophical  movement  that  first  appeared  in  ancient  Greece  and lasted well into the Roman era.
**Stoicism** taught that humans should seek to free themselves from joy,
grief,  and  passions  of  all  kinds  in  order  to  attain  wisdom;  its  teachings  thus  have  much  in  common with  Buddhism.  The  great  Stoics  include  the  statesman  **Cicero**,  the  playwright  **Seneca**,  and  the emperor **Marcus Aurelius**, whose *Meditations* is the most famous book of Stoic philosophy. Today we admire the kind of stoicism that enables some people (who may never have even heard of Marcus Aurelius) to **endure** both mental and physical **pain without complaint**.
