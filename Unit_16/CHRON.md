- CHRON comes from the Greek word for “time.” A chronicle records the events of a particular time,
which  is  why  so  many  newspapers  have  the  name  Chronicle.  A  chronometer  is  a  device  for
measuring  time,  usually  one  that's  more  accurate  (and  more  expensive)  than  an  ordinary  watch  or
clock.

- [[chronic]] 
annoying or troubling; habitual. 

  (1)  Lasting  a  long  time  or  recurring  frequently.  (2)  Always  present;  constantly

• He had stopped to pick up ice-cream cones for the kids, hoping it would give him a temporary rest
from their chronic bickering. 

Chronic  coughing  goes  on  and  on;  chronic  lateness  occurs  day  after  day;  chronic  lameness  never
seems  to  get  any  better.  Unfortunately,  situations  that  we  call  chronic  almost  always  seem  to  be
unpleasant. We never hear about chronic peace, but we do hear about chronic warfare. And we never
speak of chronic health, only of chronic illness.

- [[chronology]] 
account that presents events in order. 

 (1) A sequence of events in the order they occurred. (2) A table, list, or

• The scandal had gotten so complex that the newspaper had to print a chronology showing the order
of the numerous events involved. 

History is much more than a simple chronology of events, but keeping events in chronological order
is the first essential step in thinking about it. When, for example, historians try to show how World
War I prepared the way for World War II, tracking the chronology of the events in the years between
the two wars can help in explaining a complicated historical era.

- [[anachronism]] 
period. (2) A person or thing that is out of its own time. 

  (1)  The  error  of  placing  a  person  or  thing  in  the  wrong  time

• A Model T Ford putt-putting down the highway at 25 miles per hour was an anachronism by 1940. 

In  Shakespeare's  time,  playwrights  didn't  worry  much  about  anachronisms.  When  Shakespeare  saw
his  plays  performed,  all  the  characters,  even  Romans  and  Greeks,  would  have  been  dressed  in  the
clothes  of  his  own  period.  Macbeth,  which  is  set  in  the  11th  century,  contains  anachronistic
references to clocks and cannons, which the real Macbeth would have known nothing about. Today, a
writer may spend months doing research in order to avoid anachronisms in the historical novel she's
working on. Using the second meaning of the word, we could say that manual typewriters and slide
rules  are  anachronisms  in  these  days  of  computers  and  calculators,  and  a  person  who  likes  doing
things the old-fashioned way might himself be described as an anachronism.

- [[synchronous]] 
Recurring or acting at exactly the same intervals. 

  (1)  Happening  or  existing  at  exactly  the  same  time;  simultaneous.  (2)

•  The  theory  depends  on  whether  the  chemical  appeared  in  synchronous  deposits  worldwide  seven
million years ago. 

Communications satellites are usually put into a synchronous (or geosynchronous) orbit, circling the
earth once every 24 hours and so appearing to hover over a single spot on the surface. This type of
synchronized movement is important, since you have to know where to aim your satellite dish. In the
computer field, synchronous usually refers to the use of a simple timing signal that permits very rapid
exchange  of  data  between  computers.  The  kind  of  mysterious  coincidence  sometimes  called
synchronicity—such  as  the  appearance  of  two  different  comic-strip  characters  named  Dennis  the
Menace in the U.S. and Britain within three days of each other in 1951—has fascinated people for
centuries.
