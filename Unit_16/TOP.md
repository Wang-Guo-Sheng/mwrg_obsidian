TOP comes from topos, the Greek word for “place.” A topic is a subject rather than a place; to the
Greeks,  the  original  word  meant  more  or  less  “about  one  place  or  subject  (rather  than  another)”—
which just goes to show that it's not always easy to trace a word's meaning from its roots.

- [[topical]] 
to the topics of the day. 

 (1) Designed for local application to or treatment of a bodily part. (2) Referring

• If the topical ointment doesn't work on the rash, the doctor will prescribe an antibiotic pill. 

Like  a  topical  medicine,  a  topical  reference  or  story  applies  to  something  specific,  focusing  on  a
topic  that's  currently  in  the  news.  TV  comedians  often  use  topical  humor,  making  jokes  about  a
currently popular movie or the latest political scandal—if possible, one that just broke that same day.
Topical humor has a short lifespan, though, because the news keeps changing and the new hot topics
just  keep  coming.  The  medical  meaning  of  topical  stays  closer  to  the  meaning  of  the  root,  since  it
describes something that's put right on the place that seems to need it.

- [[ectopic]] 

 Occurring or originating in an abnormal place. 

• A pacemaker was installed to correct her ectopic heartbeat. 

Ectopic  is  a  medical  word  that  means  basically  “out  of  place.”  An  ectopic  kidney  is  located  in  an
abnormal  position.  In  patients  with  an  ectopic  heartbeat,  the  electrical  signals  that  trigger  the  heart
muscles originate in an abnormal area of the heart. But ectopic most commonly describes a pregnancy
in which the fertilized egg begins to develop in an area outside the uterus, such as in a fallopian tube;
such pregnancies may lead to serious problems if not treated.

- [[utopian]] 
conditions are perfect. 

  Relating  to  an  imaginary  place  in  which  the  government,  laws,  and  social

• Some of the new mayor's supporters had gotten increasingly unrealistic, and seemed to expect that
she could turn the city into a utopian community. 

In 1516 Thomas More published Utopia,  a  description  of  a  fictional  island  in  the  Atlantic  with  an
ideal society, in order to draw a sharp contrast with the disorderly political situation of his own time.
He  created  the  name  from  topos  (“place”)  and  ou,  Greek  for  “no,”  since  he  was  well  aware  that
nowhere  so  perfect  was  likely  to  exist  on  earth.  People  have  long  dreamed  of  creating  utopian
communities;  some  of  them  have  joined  communes,  societies  where  other  idealists  like  themselves
have  chosen  to  live  in  a  cooperative  way  according  to  certain  principles.  Not  just  communes  but
plans of all kinds have been labeled utopian by critics. But we can dream, can't we?

- [[topography]] 
a map or chart. (2) The features of a surface, including both natural and man-made features. 

 (1) The art of showing the natural and man-made features of a region on

• Planning the expedition involved careful study of the region's topography. 

Topography combines top- [[with]] graph-, a root meaning “write” or “describe.” The topography of the
Sahara Desert features shifting sand dunes and dry, rocky mountains. A topographic (or topo) map
not  only  shows  the  surface  features  of  a  region  but  also  indicates  the  contours  and  approximate
altitude of every location, by means of numerous curving lines, each indicating a single elevation. In
other  words,  it  shows  a  “three-dimensional”  picture  on  a  two-dimensional  surface.  Topo  maps  are
commonly used by hikers, surveyors, government workers, and engineers, among other people.

- CENTR/CENTER comes from the Greek kentron and the Latin centrum, meaning “sharp point” or
