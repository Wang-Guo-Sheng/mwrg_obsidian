- DOM comes from the Latin domus, “house,” and dominus, “master,” and the two are indeed related.
In the Bible, King Ahasuerus, angered by his queen's disobedience, proclaims that “every man is to
be master of his own house,” and in the Roman empire no one doubted that this was how it was meant
to be. A domain is the area where a person has authority or is dominant—but we no longer think of a
house as the domain of a single dominant member of a family.

- [[dominion]] 

 (1) An area over which one rules; domain. (2) Supreme authority. 

•  The  Roman  empire  had  dominion  over  the  entire  Mediterranean,  which  the  Romans  called  mare
nostrum, “our sea.” 

The ruler of a region has dominion over it, and the area itself may be called the ruler's dominion. In
the  days  of  the  British  Empire,  England  had  dominion  over  many  countries  throughout  the  world.
Though Canada has been quite independent of Great Britain since the 19th century, it was generally
referred to as the Dominion of Canada in official documents until at least the 1950s. The word has an
old-fashioned  sound  today,  and  probably  shows  up  in  history  books,  historical  novels,  and  fantasy
video games more often than in discussions of modern nations.

- [[predominant]] 

 Greater in importance, strength, influence, or authority. 

• The predominant color of the desert landscape was a rusty brown. 

Something predominant stands out above all the rest. The predominant theme in an essay is the one
that predominates—the main idea that the writer wants to express. (Notice the difference between the
adjective and the verb; be sure not to spell the adjective with an -ate ending.) The word is widely
used  in  many  fields.  For  example,  the  predominant  language  of  Switzerland  is  German;  the
predominant  cause  of  obesity  in  children  is  a  bad  diet;  and  your  predominant  reason  for  wanting  a
larger  vocabulary  may  be  to  simply  be  a  better-educated  person—though  the  positive  effects  of  a
large vocabulary on one's romantic life are well known.

- [[domineering]] 

 Tending to control the behavior of others in a bossy manner. 

•  His  mother  was  a  domineering  type,  and  not  even  his  stepfather  dared  do  anything  without  her
permission. 

To be domineering is to behave like a lord. (The word lordly doesn't express quite the same thing.)
Someone who tells you what you can wear or what friends you can spend time with could be called
domineering;  so  could  someone  who  always  decides  what  you're  going  to  do  with  your  free  time.
Those of us who grow up with a domineering parent usually flee as soon as we're old enough.

- [[domination]] 
governing or controlling influence. 

  (1)  Supremacy  or  power  over  another.  (2)  The  exercise  of

•  The  region  was  under  the  domination  of  a  single  nation,  even  though  it  hadn't  yet  invaded  its
neighbors. 

Domination  may  sound  like  something  that's  achieved  by  military  force.  The  total  domination  of
Europe,  for  example,  has  never  been  achieved:  The  Roman  empire  could  never  fully  dominate  the
northern  Germanic  tribes;  Napoleon  couldn't  conquer  Spain;  and  although  Adolf  Hitler  was  briefly
dominant  over  most  of  the  continent,  he  never  managed  to  overpower  England.  But  the  word's
earliest  appearances  don't  necessarily  involve  physical  force;  Chaucer,  for  instance,  speaks  of  a
mind's  domination  by  strong  drink.  So  we  may  observe  that  a  great  tennis  player  has  continued  his
domination of the world's courts this season, or that the domination of popular music by rock and roll
was obvious by the end of the 1950s.

- OMNI comes from the Latin word omnis, meaning “all.” So in English words, omni- [[can]] mean “in
