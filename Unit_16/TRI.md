TRI means “three,” whether derived from Greek or Latin. A tricycle has three wheels. A triangle has
three sides and three angles. And a triumvirate is a board or government of three people.

- [[triad]] 
organization. 

 (1) A group of three usually related people or things. (2) A secret Chinese criminal

• The kids in the garage band next door seemed to know six or seven triads and a couple of seventh
chords. 

The best-known type of triad is a type of musical chord consisting of three notes. A D-major triad is
made up of the notes D, F-sharp, and A; an F-minor triad is made up of F, A-flat, and C; and so on.
Major and minor triads form the basis of tonal music, and songs and other pieces usually end with a
triadic harmony. In medicine, a triad is a set of three symptoms that go together. The Chinese criminal
organizations called triads got their name from the triangular symbol that they used back when they
began,  centuries  ago,  as  patriotic  organizations.  Today,  with  over  100,000  members,  the  triads
operate in the U.S., Canada, and many other countries.

  A  series  of  three  creative  works  that  are  closely  related  and  develop  a  single

• William Faulkner's famous “Snopes trilogy” consists of the novels The Hamlet, The Town, and The
Mansion. 

Dozens  of  tragic  trilogies  were  written  for  the  Greek  stage,  though  only  one,  Aeschylus's  great
Oresteia  (consisting  of  Agamemnon,  The  Libation  Bearers,  and  The  Eumenides),  has  survived
complete. Authors in later years have occasionally chosen to create trilogies to allow themselves to
develop  a  highly  complex  story  or  cover  a  long  span  of  time.  Tolkien's  Lord  of  the  Rings  wasn't
actually  intended  as  a  trilogy,  but  since  it  was  published  in  three  volumes  it's  usually  called  one.
George Lucas's three original Star Wars movies are an example of a film trilogy (which he followed
many years later by another).

- [[triceratops]] 
period and had three horns, a bony crest or hood, and hoofed toes. 

  One  of  a  group  of  large  dinosaurs  that  lived  during  the  Cretaceous

•  The  triceratops  probably  used  its  three  horns  for  defense  against  the  attacks  of  meat-eating
dinosaurs. 

The name triceratops, meaning literally “three-horned face,” refers to the two horns above its eyes
and the smaller third horn on its snout. Just as striking was the frilled hood or ruff that rose behind its
head,  though  no  one  is  quite  sure  what  it  was  for.  The  triceratops  was  one  of  the  last  dinosaurs  to
evolve and also one of the last to become extinct. It could reach lengths of 30 feet and could stand
nearly  eight  feet  high.  Despite  its  ferocious  looks  and  three-foot-long  horns,  the  triceratops  was
actually a vegetarian.

- [[trident]] 
mythology. 

  A  three-pronged  spear,  especially  one  carried  by  various  sea  gods  in  classical

• The bronze statue at the middle of the great fountain depicted a sea god emerging from the water,
wreathed in seaweed and carrying a large trident. 

A trident has three prongs or teeth, as the root dent, “tooth,” tells us. The trident has long been used to
spear fish in different parts of the world, so there's no mystery about why the Greek sea god Poseidon
and his Roman counterpart Neptune both carry a trident as their symbol. In some gladiator exhibitions
in ancient Rome, one gladiator, called a retiarius (“net man”), would be equipped as though he were
a  fisherman,  with  a  weighted  net  and  a  trident;  with  his  net  he  would  snare  his  sword-wielding
opponent, and with his trident he would spear his helpless foe.

- [[trimester]] 
human pregnancy. (2) One of three terms into which an academic year is sometimes divided. 

 (1) A period of about three months, especially one of three such periods in a

• Most women experience morning sickness in the first trimester of pregnancy. 

Semester,  which  comes  from  the  Latin  words  for  “six”  and  “month,”  has  come  to  mean  half  an
academic year when the year is divided into two segments. When an academic year is divided into
three segments, each is called a trimester (which is usually a bit more accurate, since each segment
often  is  close  to  three  months  in  length).  Some  colleges  operate  on  the  “quarter”  system,  with  the
summer  being  the  fourth  quarter,  but  this  just  means  that  each  quarter  is  basically  a  trimester.  In  a
human  pregnancy,  a  trimester  is  three  months  long,  representing  one-third  of  the  nine  months  that  a
typical pregnancy lasts.

- [[trinity]] 
God in Christian belief. (2) A group of three people. 

 (1) (capitalized) The unity of Father, Son, and Holy Spirit as three persons in one

• In Christian art depicting the Trinity, the Holy Spirit is almost always shown as a radiant dove. 

The nature of the Trinity (or Holy Trinity) has caused centuries of argument and division within the
Christian  faith.  The  word  doesn't  actually  appear  in  the  Bible  itself,  but  the  New  Testament  does
speak  of  the  Father,  Son,  and  Holy  Spirit  together;  the  Father  is  understood  as  the  protector  of  the
Jews, the Son as the savior of mankind, and the Holy Spirit as the preserver of the church. Almost all
the  major  Christian  sects  may  be  called  trinitarian.  The  island  of  Trinidad  is  one  of  many  places
named with the Spanish translation of Trinity.

- [[triptych]] 
Something composed or presented in three sections. 

  (1)  A  picture  or  carving  made  in  the  form  of  three  panels  side  by  side.  (2)

• The Renaissance produced many beautiful triptychs portraying religious scenes that are still used as
altarpieces. 

Triptych  contains  the  root  -ptyche,  the  Greek  word  for  “fold.”  So  a  traditional  painted  or  carved
triptych  has  three  hinged  panels,  and  the  two  outer  panels  fold  in  toward  the  central  one.  Most
triptychs were intended to be mounted over a church altar. Many great triptychs were produced in the
Renaissance, perhaps the most famous being Hieronymus Bosch's Garden of Earthly Delights.  But
major  triptychs  continued  to  be  produced  throughout  the  20th  century  by  such  painters  as  Francis
Bacon.

- [[trivial]] 

 Of little value or importance. 

• She was so caught up in the trivial details of the trip that she hardly noticed the beautiful scenery. 

Trivial  comes  from  a  Latin  word  meaning  “crossroads”—that  is,  where  three  roads  come  together.
Since a crossroads is a very public place where all kinds of people might show up, trivialis came to
mean  “commonplace”  or  “vulgar.”  Today  the  English  word  has  changed  slightly  in  meaning  and
instead usually describes something barely worth mentioning. Mathematicians use the word to refer to
some part of a proof or definition that's extremely simple and needn't be explained, but the rest of us
tend  to  use  it  just  to  mean  “unimportant.”  “Small  talk”  at  a  party,  for  example,  is  usually  trivial
conversation, though a trivial excuse for not going on a date (“I have to wash my hair”) might hide an
emotion that isn't so trivial (“I can't stand the sight of you”). To trivialize something is to treat it as if
it didn't matter, as if it were just another triviality.
