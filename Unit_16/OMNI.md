- OMNI comes from the Latin word omnis, meaning “all.” So in English words, omni- [[can]] mean “in
all ways,” “in all places,” or “without limits.” An omnidirectional antenna, for example, is one that
receives  or  sends  radio  waves  equally  well  in  all  directions.  And  Omni  by  itself  has  been  used
repeatedly as a brand name for things as different as a hotel chain and a science magazine.

- [[omnivore]] 

 An animal that eats both plants and other animals. 

• If we're all natural omnivores, she kept asking herself, then why wouldn't her toddler eat anything
but cashews and peanut butter until the age of four? 

Human beings seem to be classic omnivores. Originally living as “hunter-gatherers,” we hunted and
fished  when  possible  but  also  gathered  nuts,  berries,  fruits,  seeds,  and  roots  for  much  of  our  diet.
We're physically well suited for both tasks; our hands are perfect for picking things, and our build is
ideal  for  running  down  even  the  fastest  game  animals  because  of  our  great  stamina.  Some  10,000
years  ago  humans  began  practicing  agriculture  involving  both  animals  and  plants.  The  other
omnivorous  mammals  include  chimpanzees,  pigs,  opossums,  porcupines,  bears,  raccoons,  skunks,
chipmunks, mice and rats, and skunks. But even many mammals classed as carnivorous (see VOR)
turn out to be capable of shifting to plant foods when necessary.

- [[omnipotent]] 

 Having complete or unlimited power; all-powerful. 

• What really scares these men is the nightmare of an omnipotent state, and they think that with their
guns they'll be able to keep the government's forces at bay when the time comes. 

If  you  know  that  potens  means  “power”  in  Latin  (see  POT),  it's  not  hard  to  guess  the  meaning  of
omnipotent. In Christian services and prayers, the Latin omnipotens is translated as “almighty” and
always applied to God. But omnipotence in a government or ruler is naturally a bit scary; as a British
lord observed a century ago, “Power tends to corrupt, and absolute power corrupts absolutely.” So
democracies do their best to make omnipotence impossible.

- [[omnibus]] 

 Of or including many things. 

• Eager to go home for vacation, Senate leaders assembled an omnibus bill to tie up the loose ends on
dozens of unrelated projects. 

In  Latin,  omnibus  means  “for  all.”  So  an  omnibus  bill  in  Congress  packages  several  measures
together, an omnibus survey may poll the public on a wide range of issues, and an omnibus edition of
a writer's stories may bring together just about all of them. As a noun, omnibus used to mean a large
vehicle  for  public  transportation—that  is,  “for  all”  who  could  pay  the  fare—but  around  1900  the
word began to be shortened to simply bus.

- [[omniscient]] 

 Knowing everything; having unlimited understanding or knowledge. 

•  Brought  up  in  a  strict  Christian  family,  he  knew  that  an  omniscient  God  was  watching  him  every
second of his life. 

Omniscience is something that a totalitarian state may try to achieve by means of informers, cameras,
and  monitoring  of  electronic  communication.  If  your  English  teacher  tells  you  that  a  novel  has  an
“omniscient narrator,'' she means that the voice telling the story isn't one of the characters but instead
knows what each of them is doing and thinking, with the point of view constantly shifting from one to
another.
