- TEMPOR comes from the Latin tempus, meaning “time.” A temporary repair is meant to last only a
short time. The tempo, or speed, of a country-and-western ballad is usually different from that of a
hip-hop number. The Latin phrase Tempus fugit means “Time flies,” an observation that seems more
true during summer vacation than in the dead of winter.

- [[temporal]] 
life as opposed to heavenly existence. (2) Having to do with time as distinguished from space. 

 (1) Having to do with time as opposed to eternity; having to do with earthly

•  The  quick  passing  of  the  seasons  as  we  grow  older  makes  us  feel  the  fleeting  nature  of  temporal
existence. 

Temporal existence is often contrasted with spiritual existence, which many religions teach is eternal.
The American system of government features a separation of church and state—that is, a separation of
spiritual and temporal authority. But such separation is relatively recent. In past centuries, the Roman
Catholic  Church  exerted  temporal  authority—that  is,  political  power—throughout  much  of  Europe,
and the Church of England has always been officially headed by the temporal ruler of Great Britain.
Temporal  isn't  always  used  in  religious  contexts;  for  example,  child  psychologists  often  measure
“temporal  processing”—that  is,  speed  of  thinking—in  children  with  mental  difficulties.  Note  that
temporal  may  also  mean  “near  the  temples  (of  the  head)”;  thus,  your  brain's  temporal  lobes  are
situated at your temples. But this temporal is based on a different Latin root.

- [[contemporary]] 
Having to do with the present period; modern or current. 

 (1) Occurring or existing during the same period of time. (2)

•  The  two  scientists  were  contemporary  with  each  other,  but  neither  seemed  to  have  heard  of  the
other's existence. 

Contemporary  can  be  confusing  because  of  its  slightly  different  meanings.  In  everyday  use,  it
generally  means  simply  “modern”  or  “new.”  But  before  the  20th  century  it  instead  referred  only  to
things  from  the  same  era  as  certain  other  things;  so,  for  instance,  Jesus  was  contemporary  with  the
Roman emperors Augustus and Tiberius, and Muhammad was contemporary with Pope Gregory the
Great. And contemporary is also a noun: thus, Jane Austen's contemporaries included Coleridge and
Wordsworth, and your own contemporaries were born around the same year that you were.

- [[extemporaneous]] 
of the moment; impromptu or improvised. (2) Carefully prepared but delivered without notes. 

 (1) Composed, performed, spoken, or done on the spur

• It was once common in middle-class homes to make extemporaneous speeches, recite poetry, and
give little solo song recitals after a dinner with guests. 

The  ability  to  speak  well  extemporaneously  is  an  important  talent  for  politicians,  especially  when
participating  in  debates.  (Though  it's  also  a  good  idea  to  have  a  “spin  doctor”  who  can  go  out
afterward  and  tell  everyone  what  the  candidate  really  meant  to  say.)  Some  people  claim  there's  a
difference  between  extemporaneous  and  impromptu,  saying  that  an  extemporaneous  speech  is
planned beforehand but not written down, while an impromptu speech is genuinely unprepared or off-
the-cuff, but today the two words are mostly used as synonyms.

- [[temporize]] 
opinion. (2) To draw out discussions to gain time. 

 (1) To act in a way that fits the time or occasion; to give way to current

• The legislature was accused of temporizing while the budget deficit continued to worsen. 

The  Latin  word  that  temporize  comes  from  meant  simply  “to  pass  the  time”;  the  meaning  of  the
English  word  is  different  but  obviously  related.  People  aren't  usually  admired  for  temporizing.  A
political leader faced with a difficult issue may temporize by talking vaguely about possible solutions
without actually doing anything. The point is to avoid taking an action that lots of people aren't going
to like, in hopes that the problem will somehow go away, but the effect is often just to make matters
worse.

- CHRON comes from the Greek word for “time.” A chronicle records the events of a particular time,
