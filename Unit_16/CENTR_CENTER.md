- CENTR/CENTER comes from the Greek kentron and the Latin centrum, meaning “sharp point” or
“center  point  of  a  circle.”  A  centrifuge  is  a  spinning  machine  that  throws  things  outward  from  the
center; the apparent force that pushes them outward is called centrifugal force.

- [[eccentric]] 
a circular path; off-center. 

 (1) Not following an established or usual style or conduct. (2) Straying from

• She keeps a dozen stray cats in her house and is rather eccentric, but her neighbors say she's very
pleasant and completely harmless. 

An  eccentric  wheel  spins  unevenly,  and  an  eccentric  person  is  similarly  a  little  off-center.  Most
eccentricities  are  inoffensive  to  others,  and  some  may  even  do  some  good.  For  instance,  riding  a
bicycle  to  work  might  be  considered  eccentric  by  some  people,  but  it's  good  exercise  and  it  cuts
down on pollution. Some eccentrics are just ahead of their time.

- [[epicenter]] 
earthquake. (2) The center or focus of activity. 

  (1)  The  location  on  the  earth's  surface  directly  above  the  focus  of  an

•  The  destruction  caused  by  Mexico  City's  earthquake  was  extensive  because  the  city  was  at  the
quake's epicenter. 

The meaning of epi- [[in]] epicenter is “over,” so the epicenter of an earthquake lies over the center or
“focus” of the quake. Epicenter can also refer to the centers of things that may seem in their own way
as powerful—though not as destructive—as earthquakes. Wall Street, for example, might be said to
lie at the epicenter of the financial world.

- [[egocentric]] 

 Overly concerned with oneself; self-centered. 

•  He's  brilliant  but  completely  egocentric,  and  the  only  things  he'll  talk  about  are  his  own  life  and
work. 

Ego means “I” in Latin. To an egocentric person, I is the most important word in the language. Great
artists  and  writers  are  often  egocentrics;  such  people  can  be  hard  to  live  with,  though  their
egocentricity, an unfortunate side effect of their talent, is often forgiven. But ordinary egocentricity,
which  shows  up  as  selfishness,  lack  of  sympathy,  and  lack  of  interest  in  other  people,  usually  has
little to do with any personal talent or success.

- [[ethnocentric]] 
superior to others. 

  Marked  by  or  based  on  the  attitude  that  one's  own  group  is

•  Some  reviewers  criticized  the  ethnocentric  bias  that  came  through  in  the  way  the  film  portrayed
immigrants. 

The  Greek  word  ethnos  means  “nation”  or  “people.”  So  ethnocentricity  shows  itself  in  a  lack  of
respect for other ways of life, and an ethnocentric person feels that his or her own nation or group is
the cultural center of the world. Ethnocentric describes the kind of person who behaves badly when
traveling in foreign countries, often called an “Ugly American” (from a book and movie of the same
name). Whenever you hear someone making fun of the way a foreigner speaks English, just remember
that it's the foreigner, not the person laughing at him, who actually can speak a foreign language.
