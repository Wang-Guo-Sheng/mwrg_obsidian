- HOL/HOLO, meaning “whole,” comes from the Greek word holos, with the same meaning. The root
can be found in catholic. When capitalized, Catholic refers to the worldwide Christian church based
in Rome, which was once the “whole”—that is, the only—Christian church. Without the capital letter,
catholic means simply “universal” or, when describing a person, “broad in one's interests or tastes.”

- [[holistic]] 
the analysis of, treatment of, or dissection into parts. 

 Relating to or concerned with wholes or with complete systems rather than with

• Environmental scientists tend to be holistic in their views, even when they're only studying a tiny
patch of ground. 

“The whole is greater than the sum of its parts” expresses the essence of holism, a term coined by the
great South African general and statesman Jan Smuts in 1926. Holism generally opposes the Western
tendency  toward  analysis,  the  breaking  down  of  wholes  into  parts  sometimes  to  the  point  that  “you
can't see the forest for the trees.” Holism is an important concept in the sciences and social sciences,
and especially in medicine. Holistic medicine tries to treat the “whole person” rather than focusing
too  narrowly  on  single  symptoms.  It  emphasizes  the  connections  between  the  mind  and  the  body,
avoids the overuse of drugs, and has borrowed such practices from Eastern traditions as acupuncture
and yoga.

• When holograms are used for data storage, the entire bulk of the storage material can be used rather
than just its surface. 

A hologram is a picture of a “whole” object, showing it in three dimensions. We've all seen cheap
holographic  images  on  credit  cards  and  ID  cards  (where  they  help  prevent  copying).  Far  more
impressive are large holograms that take the form of a ghostly 3-D moving figure that you can walk
around to see from all angles. Holograms were invented in 1947 but only perfected after the invention
of the laser in 1960. Today they're used in such technologies as compact-disc players and checkout
scanners,  and  holograms  can  be  created  of  the  inside  of  live  internal  organs  to  permit  doctors  to
examine the organs in great detail. And soon televisions with hologram technology may enable us to
watch in “3-D.”

- Holocene 

 Of, relating to, or being the present geologic epoch. 

• As the Holocene epoch began, the glaciers were swiftly retreating, forests were taking over the bare
land, and human beings were moving northward again in large numbers. 

To geologists, we live today in the Holocene epoch, the period that began about 10,000 years ago, at
the end of the last ice age, when humans first began practicing agriculture. But what does Holocene
have to do with “whole”? Well, in geological language, the Holocene epoch follows the Paleocene
(“remotely  recent”),  the  Eocene  (“early  recent”),  the  Oligocene  (“scarcely  recent”),  the  Miocene
(“less  recent”),  the  Pliocene  (“more  recent”),  and  the  Pleistocene  (“most  recent”)  epochs—so  the
Holocene is the “wholly recent” period of geological time.

- [[holocaust]] 
  (1)  (usually  capitalized)  The  mass  slaughter  of  European  civilians  and
especially  Jews  by  the  Nazis  during  World  War  II.  (2)  A  thorough  destruction  involving  extensive
loss of life, especially through fire. 

• Her parents had escaped the Holocaust in Poland by fleeing into the forest and surviving there with
hundreds of others for two years. 

The Greek word holokaustos means “burnt whole.” For the early Jews who followed the laws given
in the first books of the Bible, a holocaust was a sacrifice to God, the burning on an altar of a lamb,
goat,  or  young  bull.  The  word  is  used  about  200  times  in  the  traditional  Greek  version  of  the  Old
Testament, though it rarely appears in English translations. In the 1700s holocaust began to be used to
refer to the mass destruction of life. But no mass murder in Western history ever approached the scale
achieved by the Nazis. As many as 6 million Jews may have died at their hands; when the slaughter of
non-Jews is included, the number of murdered victims may have amounted to over 15 million.
