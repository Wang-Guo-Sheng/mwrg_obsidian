- RETRO means “back,” “backward,” or “behind” in Latin. Retro in English is generally a prefix, but
has also become a word in its own right, usually used to describe old styles or fashions.

- [[retroactive]] 

 Intended to apply or take effect at a date in the past. 

• The fact that the tax hike was retroactive annoyed the public the most. 

We  normally  think  of  time  as  constantly  moving  forward.  Since  retroactive  seems  to  defy  time's
forward movement, retroactive taxes, laws, and regulations are often seen as particularly obnoxious
and unfair. (See also ex post facto.) But nobody ever objects to receiving a retroactive raise at work.
When  we  judge  historical  people  and  events  in  terms  of  present-day  morality  and  attitudes,  our
retroactive judgments may indicate that we're too impressed with ourselves and ignorant of history.

- [[retrofit]] 
or unavailable at the time of manufacture. 

 To furnish something with new or modified parts or equipment that was optional

•  The  office  building  has  been  retrofitted  with  air-conditioning,  but  the  result  has  been  a  mixed
success. 

The  concept  of  retrofitting  became  an  urgent  necessity  during  World  War  II,  when  weapons
technology  was  advancing  at  an  intense  pace  and  planes  and  ships  were  becoming  outdated  even
before their construction was complete, and the only solution was to retrofit the completed craft with
the brand-new technology. Retrofitting was revived on a massive scale during the energy crisis of the
1970s, when new features were added to millions of old houses to make them more energy-efficient.
Retrofitting is thus different from merely renovating, which may not involve any new technology at
all.

- [[retrogress]] 

 To return to an earlier and usually worse or more primitive state. 

• According to the tests, the sophomores had actually retrogressed in the course of spring term. 

As you might guess, retrogress is the opposite of progress. Retrogression is usually an undesirable
decline from a higher or advanced level. So, for instance, in difficult social situations an adolescent
can retrogress to a childish level of maturity. And under the extreme conditions of total war, a whole
society  may  retrogress  to  a  primitive  state.  The  increasing  number  of  poor  or  homeless  people  has
been  seen  as  evidence  of  modern  social  retrogression,  and  the  rise  of  loud,  name-calling  TV  and
radio personalities strikes many people as a sign of political retrogression.

- [[retrospective]] 
covering an artist's output to date. 

  A  generally  comprehensive  exhibition  or  performance  usually

•  A  retrospective  covering  the  photographer's  entire  career  is  forcing  critics  to  revise  their  earlier
estimates of her status as an artist. 

Retrospective is partly rooted in the Latin verb specere, “to look,” so a retrospective is a look back
at an artist's career. The subject of a retrospective is usually an older living artist, or one who has
recently died. Galleries and museums honor painters and sculptors, film festivals honor directors and
actors, and concert organizations honor composers. Retrospectives can be difficult and expensive to
assemble, so they're rarely put together except for deserving artists; the result is that they frequently
win many new fans for the person's achievement.
