偷窃癖

A  mental  illness  in  which  a  person  has  a  strong  desire  to  steal things. 

• Kleptomania leads its sufferers to steal items of little value that they don't need anyway. 

Klepto- comes from the Greek word kleptein, “to steal.” Even though kleptomania is often the butt of jokes, it's actually a serious mental illness, often associated with mood disorders, anxiety disorders, eating disorders, and substance abuse. Klepotomaniacs tend to be depressed, and many live lives of secret shame because they're afraid to seek treatment.
