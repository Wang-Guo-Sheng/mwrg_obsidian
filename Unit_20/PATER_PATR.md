- PATER/PATR comes from both the Greek and the Latin word for “father.” So a patron, for example,
is someone who assumes a fatherly role toward an institution or project or individual, giving moral
and financial support.

- [[patrician]] 

 A person of high birth or of good breeding and cultivation; an aristocrat. 

• They passed themselves off as patricians, and no one looked too closely at where their money came
from. 

A patrician was originally a descendant of one of the original citizen families of ancient Rome. Until
about 350 B.C., only patricians could hold the office of senator, consul, or pontifex (priest). Later, the
word  was  applied  to  members  of  the  nobility  created  by  the  Roman  emperor  Constantine.  As  time
went  by,  other  nobles,  such  as  those  in  medieval  Italian  republics  and  in  German  city-states,  also
came to be known as patricians. Today someone's appearance, manners, or tastes can be described as
patrician, whether the person is actually of high birth or not. The actress Grace Kelly, an immigrant's
daughter, was admired for her patrician beauty even before she became Princess Grace of Monaco,
with classic features worthy of ancient Rome's finest sculptors.

- [[patriarchy]] 
men. (2) A social system in which family members are related to each other through their fathers. 

  (1)  A  family,  group,  or  government  controlled  by  a  man  or  a  group  of

•  She  spent  the  1980s  raging  against  the  patriarchy,  which  she  claimed  had  destroyed  the  lives  of
millions of women. 

With its root -arch, meaning “ruler, leader,” a patriarch is a man who dominates something, even if
it's just a family. In Christianity, the term is used for a few leading figures who appear early in the Old
Testament,  including  Methuselah,  Abraham,  Isaac,  and  Jacob;  in  the  Eastern  Orthodox  church,  a
patriarch is usually the equivalent of a bishop. Outside of the field of anthropology, patriarchy didn't
start to be used much until the 1970s, when the women's movement gained a huge following. Many
feminists  have  claimed  that  all  Western  societies  are  patriarchal—that  is,  that  they  systematically
enable men to dominate women. But there's plenty of disagreement about how this is done, and the
word isn't discussed as often as it used to be.

- [[expatriate]] 

 A person who has moved to a foreign land. 

• As he got to know his fellow expatriates in Morocco, he found himself wondering what had led each
of them to leave America. 

Expatriate combines the prefix ex-, “out of” or “away from,” with the Latin patria, “fatherland.” A
famous colony of expatriates was the group of writers and artists who gathered in Paris between the
two  world  wars,  including  Ernest  Hemingway,  F.  Scott  Fitzgerald,  and  Gertrude  Stein.  Unlike  an
exile  or  an  emigrant,  an  expatriate's  residence  abroad  is  usually  voluntary  and  extended  but  not
permanent, and expatriates—often called expats—generally keep their original national identity and
eventually end their self-imposed exiles by repatriating themselves.

- [[paternalistic]] 
under one's control. 

 Tending to supply the needs of or regulate the activities of those

• Some still accuse the university of being too paternalistic in regulating student living arrangements. 

A  good  father  shows  paternal  concern  about  his  children,  just  as  a  good  mother  often  acts  out  of
maternal  feeling.  But  paternalistic  has  a  negative  sound  nowadays,  since  paternalistic  people  or
institutions  seek—often  with  decent  intentions—to  control  many  aspects  of  the  lives  of  those  under
their  control.  In  the  19th  century,  mill  owners  actually  often  provided  cheap  housing  for  the  mill's
employees. Today companies frequently have strict rules regarding personal appearance, or against
marriages  within  the  company.  Colleges  and  universities  used  to  practice  a  kind  of  paternalism,
especially  in  trying  to  keep  men  and  women  out  of  each  other's  dorms,  but  a  changing  society  has
mostly put an end to that.
