- PURG  comes  from  the  Latin  verb  purgare,  “to  clean  or  cleanse.”  Almost  all  the  English  words
where it shows up are closely related to those discussed below.

- [[purge]] 

 (1) To clear of guilt or sin. (2) To free of something unwanted or considered impure. 

•  During  the  1930s,  Stalin  purged  the  Soviet  communist  party  of  thousands  of  members  who  he
suspected of disloyalty. 

In some cultures, a ritual bath or prayer is performed to purge guilt or evil spirits. The Minoans of
ancient Crete may have used human sacrifice as a way of purging the entire community, which is fine
for the community but rough on the victims. In many cultures, people periodically purge themselves
physically—that  is,  clean  out  their  digestive  tracts—by  taking  strong  laxatives;  this  used  to  be  a
popular springtime ritual, and herbal purgatives were readily available.

- [[expurgate]] 
objectionable parts from. 

  To  cleanse  of  something  morally  harmful  or  offensive;  to  remove

• In those years, high-school English classes only used expurgated editions of Chaucer's Canterbury
Tales. 

Expurgation  has  a  long  and  questionable  history.  Perhaps  history's  most  famous  expurgator,  or
censor, was the English editor Thomas Bowdler, who in 1818 published the Family Shakespeare, an
expurgated  edition  of  Shakespeare's  plays  that  omitted  or  changed  any  passages  that,  in  Bowdler's
opinion,  couldn't  decently  be  read  aloud  in  a  family.  As  a  result,  the  term  bowdlerize  is  now  a
synonym of expurgate.

- [[purgative]] 
looseness of the bowels. 

  (1)  Cleansing  or  purifying,  especially  from  sin.  (2)  Causing  a  significant

• I'm afraid my ten-year-old discovered the purgative effect of too many apples after a lazy afternoon
in the orchard. 

Purgative can be used as a noun as well as an adjective. For centuries, doctors prescribed purgatives
—that is, laxatives—for all kinds of ailments, not knowing anything better to do. Physical cleansing
has  always  reminded  people  of  emotional  and  spiritual  cleansing,  as  expressed  in  the  saying
“Cleanliness is next to godliness.” So we may say, for example, that confession has a purgative effect
on the soul. Some psychologists used to claim that expressing your anger is purgative; but in fact it
may generally be no better for your emotional life than taking a laxative, and can sometimes really
foul things up.

- [[purgatory]] 
 (1) According to Roman Catholic doctrine, the place where the souls of
those  who  have  died  in  God's  grace  must  pay  for  their  sins  through  suffering  before  ascending  to
heaven. (2) A place or state of temporary suffering or misery. 

• For both of them, filled with anxiety, the long, sleepless night felt like purgatory. 

Purgatory is the place where the soul is cleansed of all impurities, as Dante described in his great
poem The Divine Comedy. Today purgatory can refer to any place or situation in which suffering and
misery are felt to be sharp but temporary. Waiting to hear the results of a test, or whether you got a
good  job,  can  be  a  purgatory.  And  an  endless  after-dinner  speech  can  make  an  entire  roomful  of
people feel as if they're in purgatory.
