- PREHEND/PREHENS  comes  from  the  Latin  verb  prehendere,  “to  seize.”  Most  of  the  English
words where it appears are closely related to the ones discussed below.

- [[prehensile]] 

 Adapted for grasping, especially by wrapping around. 

• The squid has eight short “arms” but also two long prehensile tentacles that it uses for catching its
prey. 

Howler monkeys are among the American monkeys with prehensile tails. Famous for their booming
howls,  howlers  can  wrap  their  tails  around  a  nearby  branch  while  using  their  prehensile  feet  and
hands for picking lice from their fur or lobbing a coconut at an unwelcome tourist. Our own hands are
prehensile,  of  course.  Our  feet  are  not;  on  the  other  hand,  they're  much  better  for  running  than  the
prehensile feet of a monkey or ape.

- [[apprehend]] 

 (1) Arrest, seize. (2) Understand. 

• It was a few minutes before she managed to apprehend the meaning of what she had just seen. 

To apprehend is to seize, either physically or mentally. So to apprehend a thief is to nab him. But to
apprehend a confusing news story, or to apprehend a difficult concept in physics, is to understand it—
that is, to “grasp” it mentally. If you're apprehensive about something that's about to happen, it means
you've grasped all the unpleasant possibilities and are waiting with anxiety or dread.

- [[comprehend]] 

 (1) To grasp the meaning of; understand. (2) To take in or include. 

•  In  the  days  following  the  dropping  of  the  atomic  bomb  on  Hiroshima,  the  public  slowly  began  to
comprehend the fact that the nuclear age had arrived. 

To  comprehend  is  to  mentally  grasp  something's  complete  nature  or  meaning.  Comprehend  is  thus
often a bit stronger than understand: for example, you may understand the instructions in a handbook
without  completely  comprehending  their  purpose.  Comprehend's  second  meaning  is  much  less
common.  Using  that  sense  of  the  word,  we  could  say  that  good  manners  comprehends  (that  is,
includes) more than simple table etiquette, for example, or that true courage comprehends more than
just physical showing off. And something comprehensive includes a great deal: so a comprehensive
exam, for instance, includes all the material that was studied in the course.

- [[reprehensible]] 

 Deserving stern criticism or blame. 

• Whether or not he ever broke the law, his treatment of his first wife was thoroughly reprehensible. 

From  its  prefix  re-,  meaning  “back,”  reprehend  would  mean  literally  “to  hold  back,  restrain”;  but
even the Latin version of the verb had come to mean “to scold, blame”—in other words, to restrain
bad behavior by expressing disapproval. Reprehensible is applied to both things and people—that is,
both the sin and the sinner. So a senator might be scolded for reprehensible conduct, but might also be
called  a  thoroughly  reprehensible  person.  And  most  of  us  would  call  dogfighting  morally
reprehensible, and would use the same word to describe those who put the dogs up to it.
