MILL means either “a thousand” or “a thousandth.” A millennium is a thousand years, and a million
is a thousand thousands. But a milligram is a thousandth of a gram, a milliliter a thousandth of a liter,
and a millimeter a thousandth of a meter.

- [[millefleur]] 

 Having a pattern of small flowers and plants all over. 

• She was painstakingly embroidering a millefleur pattern on a pillow casing. 

Millefleur  came  into  French  from  the  Latin  mille florae  (“a  thousand  flowers”),  and  from  French
directly into English. You may have seen the famed Unicorn Tapestries, in which the unicorn is seen
frolicking,  relaxing,  being  hunted,  and  being  caught,  all  against  a  beautiful  millefleur  background.
Italian has given us the similar word millefiori; though fiori, like fleurs, means “flowers,” millefiori
actually  refers  to  a  type  of  multicolored  ornamental  glass.  And  the  borrowed  French  word  mille-
feuille (feuille meaning “leaf”) is the name of a dish made with puff pastry, the kind of pastry whose
flakes resemble thin dry leaves.

- [[millenarianism]] 
 (1) Belief in the 1,000-year era of holiness foretold in the
Book  of  Revelation.  (2)  Belief  in  an  ideal  society  to  come,  especially  one  brought  about  by
revolution. 

• Millenarianism is one of the future-oriented beliefs common in the New Age movement. 

Originally the millennium was not simply any thousand-year period, but instead the thousand years
prophesied in the biblical Book of Revelation, when holiness will prevail on earth and Jesus Christ
will preside over all. Later, millennium was extended to mean any period—always in the future—
marked  by  universal  happiness  and  human  perfection.  On  several  occasions  over  the  centuries,
members  of  Christian  sects  have  become  convinced  that  the  biblical  millennium  was  arriving  and
gathered  together  to  await  it.  But  nonreligious  millenarians  have  also  believed  in  a  future  society
marked by human perfection. Even if they regard this future as certain, they've generally been willing
to  help  it  along  by  working  for  a  political,  social,  or  economic  revolution.  The  millennium  always
seems to be approaching; to date, it hasn't arrived.

- [[millipede]] 
body with two pairs of legs on each segment, and, unlike centipedes, no poison fangs. 

 Any of a class of many-footed arthropods that have a cylindrical, segmented

• As they turned over rocks and bricks in their search for the lost bracelet, millipedes of various sizes
went scurrying off. 

The earth is home to about 10,000 species of millipedes. Though they have no poison fangs, many of
them can, when threatened, emit a liquid or gas poisonous to their enemies. If their structure were true
to  their  name,  millipedes  would  have  a  thousand  legs,  but  in  fact  they  have  far  fewer.  Even  so,  a
millipede  in  motion  is  a  sight  to  ponder:  How  can  it  possibly  coordinate  all  those  legs  so  that  it
doesn't trip over itself? Like some tiny conga line or bunny hop, it scuttles away to a rhythm only it
can hear.

- [[millisecond]] 

 One thousandth of a second. 

• A lightning bolt lasts only about 20 milliseconds, though the image may stay in one's eye for much
longer. 

A  millisecond  isn't  long  enough  for  the  blink  of  an  eye,  but  a  few  milliseconds  may  determine  the
winner of a swim race or a hundred-yard dash. With the ever-increasing speed of modern technology,
even  a  millisecond  has  started  to  seem  a  little  sluggish;  computer  operations  are  now  measured  in
nanoseconds—that is, billionths of a second.

- HEMI/SEMI  means  “half.”  Hemi-  comes  from  Greek,  semi-  from  Latin.  A  hemisphere  is  half  a
