- LEGA comes from the Latin legare, meaning “to appoint” or “to send as a deputy.” The same root
actually shows up in such words as legal—but how the law connects with sending deputies can get
awfully complicated and probably isn't worth going into.

- [[legate]] 

 An official representative, such as an ambassador. 

• All the important European powers sent legates of some kind to the peace conference. 

Legate is a somewhat old-fashioned word, less used today than it was a century ago. More common
is the synonym envoy. In the days before electronic communications, a legate often had particularly
large responsibilities, since he couldn't check with his government to be sure he was doing the right
thing. The Vatican still sends papal legates to represent the pope's point of view in negotiations.

- [[legacy]] 
ancestor or predecessor or received from the past. 

  (1)  Something  left  to  a  person  in  a  will.  (2)  Something  handed  down  by  an

• The Stradivarius family of violin makers left a priceless legacy of remarkable instruments. 

In its basic meaning, a legacy is a gift of money or other personal property that's granted by the terms
of a will—often a substantial gift that needs to be properly managed. But the word is used much more
broadly as well. So, for instance, much of Western civilization—law, philosophy, aesthetics— could
be  called  the  undying  legacy  of  ancient  Greece.  And  the  rights  and  opportunities  that  women  enjoy
today are partly the legacy of the early suffragists and feminists.

- [[delegation]] 
others. 

  A  group  of  people  chosen  to  represent  the  interests  or  opinions  of

• Each American colony sent a delegation to the Second Continental Congress, and in its second year
all 56 delegates approved Jefferson's Declaration of Independence. 

The task of a delegation—each member of which can be called a delegate—is to represent a larger
group, often at a conference. Thus, a delegation of nondoctors to a medical convention may want to
make sure the rights and needs of patients aren't ignored, just as a delegation of laypeople may attend
a religious conference to express the concerns of other laypeople.

- [[relegate]] 
decision or for carrying out. 

 (1) To remove or assign to a less important place. (2) To refer or hand over for

• First-year students were relegated to the back of the line so that all the upper classes could eat first. 

Originally  relegate  meant  “to  send  into  exile,  banish.”  So  when  you  relegate  an  old  sofa  to  the
basement,  you're  sending  it  to  home-decorating  Siberia.  When  confronted  with  a  matter  that  no  one
really wants to face, a chief executive may relegate it to a committee “for further study,” which may
manage to ignore it for years. It may be annoying to read a newspaper article about a pet project and
find that your own contributions have been relegated to a short sentence near the end.

- GREG comes from the Latin grex, “herd” or “flock.” Bees, starlings, cows—any creatures that like
