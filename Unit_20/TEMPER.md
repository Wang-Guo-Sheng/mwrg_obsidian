- TEMPER  comes  from  the  Latin  verb  temperare,  “to  moderate  or  keep  within  limits”  or  “to  mix.”
Most  of  the  world's  people  live  in  the  temperate zone—that is, the zone where the temperature  is
moderate, between the hot tropics and the icy Arctic and Antarctic Circles. It's less easy to see how
we get temperature  from  this  root;  the  word  actually  used  to  refer  to  the  mixing  of  different  basic
elements in the body, and only slowly came to mean how hot or cold that body was.

- [[temper]] 

 To dilute, qualify, or soften by adding something more agreeable; to moderate. 

• A wise parent tempers discipline with love. 

The temper root keeps its basic meaning—“to mix” or “to keep within limits”—in the English word
temper.  When  you  temper  something,  you  mix  it  with  some  balancing  quality  or  substance  so  as  to
avoid  anything  extreme.  Thus,  it's  often  said  that  a  judge  must  temper  justice  with  mercy.  Young
people  only  gradually  learn  to  temper  their  natural  enthusiasms  with  caution.  And  in  dealing  with
others, we all try to temper our honesty with sensitivity.

- [[temperance]] 
little or no alcohol. 

  (1)  Moderation  in  satisfying  appetites  or  passions.  (2)  The  drinking  of

• Buddhism teaches humankind to follow “the middle way”—that is, temperance in all things. 

Since  temperance  means  basically  “moderation,”  you  might  assume  that,  with  respect  to  alcohol,
temperance would mean moderate consumption, or “social drinking.” Instead, the word has usually
meant the prohibition of all alcohol. To temperance leaders such as Carry Nation, the safest form of
drinking  was  no  alcohol  at  all.  Believing  she  was  upholding  the  law,  Nation  began  her  hatchet-
swinging  attacks  on  saloons,  known  as  “hatchetations,”  in  the  1890s.  National  prohibition  did
eventually  come—and  go—but  largely  through  the  efforts  of  more  temperate  (that  is,  moderate)
reformers.

- [[intemperate]] 

 Not moderate or mild; excessive, extreme. 

• Lovers of fine wines and scotches are almost never intemperate drinkers. 

Since  the  prefix  in-  generally  means  “not,”  intemperate  is  the  opposite  of  temperate.  Someone
intemperate  rejects  moderation  in  favor  of  excess.  A  religious  fanatic  is  likely  to  preach  with
intemperate zeal, and a mean theater critic may become intemperate in her criticism of a new play,
filling her review with intemperate language. And both temperate and intemperate also often refer to
weather; a region with an intemperate climate isn't where all of us would choose to build a house.

- [[distemper]] 
  (1)  A  highly  contagious  viral  disease,  especially  of  dogs.  (2)  A  highly
contagious  and  usually  fatal  viral  disease,  especially  of  cats,  marked  by  the  destruction  of  white
blood cells. 

• An epidemic of feline distemper had swept the country, and its cat population had plummeted. 

Back when doctors believed that our moods were affected by an imbalance of mysterious fluids in the
body, or “humors,” distemper often meant moodiness, as when Shakespeare's Hamlet is asked “What
is  the  source  of  your  distemper?”  Today  the  word  is  used  only  for  true  physical  conditions.  The
distemper that affects dogs, often called canine distemper, also affects foxes, wolves, mink, raccoons,
and ferrets. It can be treated with medication, but is generally fatal if not treated. Distemper in cats,
known  as  feline  distemper  or  panleukopenia,  actually  isn't  related  to  canine  distemper.  If  caught
quickly, it too can be treated. And both types can be prevented by vaccination, so all responsible pet
owners get their animals vaccinated.
