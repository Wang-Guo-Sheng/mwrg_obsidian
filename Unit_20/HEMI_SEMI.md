- HEMI/SEMI  means  “half.”  Hemi-  comes  from  Greek,  semi-  from  Latin.  A  hemisphere  is  half  a
sphere, and a semicircle is half a circle. (The French prefix demi-, which probably developed from
Latin as well, also means “half”—as in demitasse, a little after-dinner coffee cup half the size of a
regular cup.)

- [[semitone]] 

 The tone at a half step. 

• The ancient piano in the great music room had been allowed to fall terribly out of tune, with every
note at least a semitone flat. 

A  semitone  (sometimes  called  a  half  tone  or  a  half  step)  is  the  distance  from  a  white  key  to  a
neighboring black key on the piano keyboard—for example, from G to G-sharp or from E to E-flat. In
an octave (from G to the next G above, for instance), there are twelve semitones. Semitones are the
smallest  intervals  that  are  used  intentionally  in  almost  any  of  the  music  you'll  normally  hear.  Two
semitones equal a whole tone—the distance from G up to A or from E down to D, for example.

- [[semicolon]] 
elements such as independent clauses. 

  The  punctuation  mark  ;  ,  used  chiefly  to  separate  major  sentence

• Some young vandal had done a search-and-replace on Mr. Marsh's computer file, and in place of
every semicolon was the mysterious message “Hendrix RULES!” 

The  semicolon  was  introduced  into  modern  type  by  an  Italian  printer  around  1566.  But  since  it's
actually the same symbol as the ancient Greek question mark, it's older than the colon (:), which first
appears around 1450. Don't mix the two up. A colon introduces something: usually a list, sometimes a
statement. A semicolon separates two independent but related clauses; it may also replace the comma
to separate items in a complicated list.

- [[hemiplegia]] 
disease of or injury to the motor centers of the brain. 

  Total  or  partial  paralysis  of  one  side  of  the  body  that  results  from

•  She's  starting  to  regain  the  use  of  her  right  hand,  and  some  of  the  therapists  think  her  hemiplegia
might eventually be reversed. 

Hemi-, unlike semi, almost always appears in scientific or technical words, including medical terms
such  as  this  one.  A  hemiplegic,  like  a  paraplegic  (who  has  lost  the  use  of  both  legs),  has  usually
suffered brain damage, often from a wound or blood clot. Other conditions that affect one side of the
body are hemihypertrophy (excessive growth on one side), hemiatrophy (wasting on one side), and
hemiparesis (weakness or partial paralysis).

- [[semiconductor]] 
temperatures and insulates like a nonmetal at low temperatures. 

  A  solid  that  conducts  electricity  like  a  metal  at  high

• Silicon, which makes up 25% of the earth's crust, is the most widely used semiconductor, and as
such has formed the basis for a revolution in human culture. 

A  semiconductor  is  a  crystal  material  whose  ability  to  conduct  electricity  rises  as  its  temperature
goes up. That is, it sometimes acts as a conductor and sometimes as an insulator. Its conducting ability
can be much increased by chemical treatment. A manufactured chip of silicon, less than half an inch
square,  may  contain  millions  of  microscopic  transistors,  which  can  serve  control  and  memory
functions when installed in a computer, automobile, cell phone, DVD player, or microwave oven.
