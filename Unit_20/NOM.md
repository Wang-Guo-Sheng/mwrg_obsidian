NOM comes from the Latin word for “name.” A nominee is a person “named”—or nominated—to
run for or serve in office. A binomial (“two names”) is the scientific name for a species: Felis catus
for the house cat, for example. A polynomial, with “many names,” is an algebra expression involving
several terms: 2x2 + 9y – z3, for instance.

- [[nominal]] 
unimportant; insignificant. 

  (1)  Existing  in  name  or  form  only  and  not  in  reality.  (2)  So  small  as  to  be

•  The  actor  himself  was  the  nominal  author,  but  90  percent  of  the  prose  was  the  work  of  his
ghostwriter. 

Something nominal exists only in name. So the nominal ruler in a constitutional monarchy is the king
or queen, but the real power is in the hands of the elected prime minister. In the United Kingdom, the
British monarch is also the nominal head of the Church of England; and those baptized in the Church
who aren't really churchgoers might be called nominal Christians. A fee can be called nominal when
it's small in comparison to the value of what it buys. So, for example, you might sell a friend a good
piece of furniture for a nominal amount. And the charge for a doctor's visit might be a nominal $20,
since most of the cost is covered by an insurance plan.

- [[nomenclature]] 
 (1) A name or designation, or the act of naming. (2) A system
of  terms  or  symbols  used  in  biology,  where  New  Latin  names  are  given  to  kinds  and  groups  of
animals and plants. 

• Naming newly discovered plants or animals requires close study of the system of nomenclature. 

Various  specialized  fields  have  their  own  particular  nomenclatures,  or  sets  of  terms.  In  particle
physics, for instance, the elementary particles known as quarks, which are believed to come in pairs,
have acquired such names as “up” and “down,” “strange” and “charm,” and “truth” and “beauty”—
which is all most of us know about quarks and all we need to know. But nomenclature is used most
often  for  the  system  of  biological  classification  created  by  Linnaeus.  In  Linnaeus's  system,  each
species has its own two-word name, the first word being the name of its genus. Thus, the genus Equus
includes  the  horse  (Equus  caballus)  and  the  mountain  zebra  (Equus  zebra).  But  since  broccoli,
cauliflower, and cabbage actually all belong to the same species (Brassica oleracea), they each need
a third name to distinguish themselves.

- [[ignominious]] 
or degrading. 

 (1) Marked with shame or disgrace; dishonorable. (2) Humiliating

• If Attila the Hun was truly murdered by his bride on their wedding night, it was a most ignominious
death for a warrior. 

The  Latin  nomen  could  mean  both  “name”  and  “good  reputation,”  and  even  today  we  can  say  that
someone who has been disgraced has “lost his good name.” With its negative prefix ig-, ignominious
indicates the “namelessness” that goes with shame or dishonor. A person who suffers an ignominious
fate may die nameless and forgotten. In the former Soviet Union, party leaders who fell out of favor,
even if they avoided being imprisoned or executed, became nonpersons. Their names were removed
from official records and history books and they were treated as if they had never existed.

- [[misnomer]] 

 A wrong name, or the use of a wrong name. 

• Calling the native peoples of the western hemisphere “Indians” was one of the great misnomers in
recorded history. 

Historians have long noted that the Holy Roman Empire in its later years was neither holy, Roman,
nor an empire. The Battle of Bunker Hill was actually fought on nearby Breed's Hill. And the famous
Woodstock Festival was actually held in the town of Bethel. But misnomers aren't limited to history.
The  Pennsylvania  Dutch  are  actually  of  German  ancestry.  Koala  bears  aren't  bears—they're
marsupials.  And  in  the  world  of  food,  the  Rocky  Mountain  oyster,  as  diners  have  sometimes
discovered too late, aren't really oysters.

- PATER/PATR comes from both the Greek and the Latin word for “father.” So a patron, for example,
