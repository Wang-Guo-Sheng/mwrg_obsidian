- FLU comes from the Latin verb fluere, “to flow.” So a flume is a narrow gorge with a stream flowing
through it. A fluent speaker is one from whom words flow easily. Influence originally referred to an
invisible  fluid  that  was  believed  to  flow  from  the  stars  and  to  affect  the  actions  of  humans.  A
mysterious outbreak of disease in 15th-century Italy led Italians to blame it on the stars' influenza—
and the name stuck.

- [[affluence]] 

 An abundance of wealth. 

• The affluence of the city's northern suburbs is indicated by the huge houses there. 

Affluence  comes  from  the  Latin  verb  affluere,  “to  flow  abundantly.”  Thus,  someone  or  something
blessed  with  affluence  has  received  an  incoming  flood  of  riches.  Since  the  affluent  residents  of
suburbs often work in the central city but pay taxes back home, the wealth of some metropolitan areas
tends to flow in one direction—out.

- [[effluent]] 

 Polluting waste material discharged into the environment. 

• The effluent from the mill had long ago turned this once-beautiful stream into a foul-smelling open-
air sewer. 

Effluent  comes  from  the  Latin  verb  effluere,  “to  flow  out.”  In  an  older  meaning,  an  effluent  was  a
stream flowing out of a river or lake. But nowadays effluent almost always means wastes that pour
into our water and air. Liquid factory waste, smoke, and raw sewage can all be called effluents. An
effluent filter keeps treated waste flowing out of a septic tank from clogging up its drainage pipes.

- [[confluence]] 
especially of two streams. 

 (1) A coming or flowing together at one point. (2) A place of meeting,

•  The  confluence  of  several  large  economic  forces  led  to  the  “perfect  storm”  that  shook  the  world
economy in 2008. 

The joining of rivers—as at Harpers Ferry, West Virginia, where the Shenandoah and Potomac Rivers
flow together spectacularly—was the original meaning of confluence,  and  in  its  later  meanings  we
still hear a strong echo of the physical merging of waters. So today we can speak of a confluence of
events, a confluence of interests, a confluence of cultures, and so on, from which something important
often emerges.

- [[mellifluous]] 

 Flowing like honey; sweetened as if with honey. 

•  His  rich,  mellifluous  voice  is  familiar  to  us  from  countless  voice-overs  for  commercials,  station
breaks, and documentaries. 

With  its  root  mel-,  meaning  “honey,”  mellifluous  means  literally  “flowing  like  honey.”  The  word
usually applies to sound; it has often been used to describe voices such as Renee Fleming's or Barbra
Streisand's, or pieces by composers such as Ravel and Debussy. The DJ on a radio station that plays
soft music may have a voice so mellifluous that it almost puts the listener to sleep.

- PREHEND/PREHENS  comes  from  the  Latin  verb  prehendere,  “to  seize.”  Most  of  the  English
