- GREG comes from the Latin grex, “herd” or “flock.” Bees, starlings, cows—any creatures that like
to live together in flocks or herds—are called gregarious, and the same word is used for people who
enjoy companionship and are happiest when they're in the middle of a rowdy herd.

- [[aggregate]] 

 A collection or sum of units or parts. 

• His lawyers realize that the aggregate of incriminating details is now pointing toward a conviction. 

An aggregate is often an example of something being greater than the sum of its parts. For instance,
even if no individual element in a person's background would assure a criminal career, the aggregate
of factors could make a life of crime seem unavoidable. Aggregate is often used in the phrase “in the
aggregate,”  as  in  “Her  achievements  were,  in  the  aggregate,  impressive  enough  to  earn  her  a
scholarship.”  Aggregate  is  also  an  adjective,  meaning  “total”;  so,  for  instance,  economists  often
discuss aggregate demand for goods and services in the country's economy, just as you yourself might
speak about your father's aggregate income from his three jobs.

- [[congregation]] 
instruction. (2) The membership of a church or temple. 

  (1)  A  gathering  of  people,  especially  for  worship  or  religious

•  That  Sunday  the  congregation  was  especially  large,  and  the  minister  delivered  one  of  his  best
sermons. 

The verb congregate  may  be  used  for  spontaneous  gatherings.  A  crowd  quickly  congregates  at  the
scene of an accident, for example, just as cows, sheep, or horses tend to congregate during a storm.
And under military rule, citizens are often forbidden to congregate on street corners or anywhere else.
But a congregation is generally a group that has gathered for a formal purpose, usually in church. The
Congregational Church was originally the church of the Puritan settlers, in which each congregation
governed its own church independent of any higher authority.

- [[egregious]] 

 Standing out, especially in a bad way; flagrant. 

• Many of the term papers contained egregious grammatical errors. 

Since egregious begins with a short version of ex-, meaning “out of,” the word should mean literally
“out  of  the  herd.”  So  something  egregious  possesses  some  quality  that  sets  it  apart  from  others.
Originally, that distinguishing quality was something good, but by the 16th century the word's meaning
had  taken  a  U-turn  and  the  word  was  being  applied  to  things  that  were  outrageously  bad.  This  has
remained the most common sense. Thus, an egregious fool is one who manages to outdo run-of-the-
mill fools, and egregious rudeness sets a new standard for unpleasant salesclerks.

- [[segregate]] 
separate along racial lines. 

  (1)  To  separate  from  others  or  from  the  general  mass;  isolate.  (2)  To

•  Some  schools  are  experimenting  with  gender  segregation,  claiming  that  both  sexes  learn  better  in
classrooms from which the other sex is absent. 

The prefix se- [[means]] “apart,” so when you segregate something you set it apart from the herd. The
word typically means separating something undesirable from the healthy majority. During the apple
harvest,  damaged  fruit  is  segregated  from  the  main  crop  and  used  for  cider.  In  prisons,  hardened
criminals  are  segregated  from  youthful  offenders.  Lepers  used  to  be  segregated  from  the  general
population  because  they  were  thought  to  be  highly  infectious.  The  opposite  of  segregate  is  often
integrate,  and  the  two  words  were  in  the  news  almost  daily  for  decades  as  African-Americans
struggled to be admitted into all-white schools and neighborhoods.
