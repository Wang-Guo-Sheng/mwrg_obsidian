- LATER comes from the Latin adjective lateralis, meaning “side.” The noun for “side” in Latin was
latus, and the same word served as an adjective meaning “wide.” The relationship between the two
isn't hard to spot, since something wide extends far out to its sides. So lines of latitude extend east-
west  around  the  earth,  in  the  dimension  we  tend  to  think  of  as  its  width  (unlike  lines  of  longitude,
which  extend  north-south,  in  the  dimension  that,  for  some  reason,  we  decided  to  think  of  as  its
“length”).

- [[lateral]] 

 Of or relating to the side. 

• Only in the lateral views did the X-rays reveal an suspicious-looking shadow on the lung. 

Lateral shows up in all kinds of contexts. A lateral job change is one that keeps you at about the same
job  level  and  salary.  A  coach  might  have  special  drills  to  improve  his  players'  lateral  speed  and
agility.  The  British  speak  of  “lateral  thinking,”  thinking  that  grabs  ideas  that  may  not  seem  to  be
relevant  but  turn  out  to  work  well—what  we  might  call  “thinking  outside  the  box.”  But  we  know
lateral best from football. A lateral pass is a pass of the ball between teammates that usually goes to
the side and slightly backward from the direction in which they're advancing; unlike a forward pass, a
lateral may be made from any position, and any number may be made in a single play.

- [[bilateral]] 

 Involving two groups or countries. 

•  Instead  of  working  on  a  set  of  separate  bilateral  trade  agreements,  they  propose  bringing  the
countries of the region together to sign a single joint agreement. 

Since the prefix bi- [[means]] “two” in Latin (see BI/BIN), bilateral means essentially “two-sided.” In
the  days  when  there  were  two  superpowers,  the  U.S.  and  the  Soviet  Union  regularly  engaged  in
bilateral  arms  negotiations;  such  negotiations  are  much  less  common  today.  Sometimes  bilateral
refers  to  two  sides  of  the  same  thing.  A  bilateral  hip  replacement,  for  instance,  replaces  both  hip
bones in the same operation. And bilateral symmetry (a term often used by biologists) refers to the
fact that, in many organisms (such as humans), the left side is basically the mirror image of the right
side.

- [[collateral]] 
or close way. 

 (1) Associated but of secondary importance. (2) Related but not in a direct

• Though the army referred to the civilian deaths as “collateral damage,” since civilians weren't the
intended targets, the incident aroused intense anger among the survivors. 

If  an  official  talking  about  some  policy  refers  to  a  collateral  issue,  he  or  she  means  something  that
may be affected but isn't central to the discussion. To an anthropologist, your cousin would be called
a  collateral  relative,  since  he  or  she  (unlike  your  grandmother,  brother,  or  daughter)  is  “off  to  the
side” of your direct line of descent. As a noun, collateral means something provided to a lender as a
guarantee  of  repayment.  So  if  you  take  out  a  loan  or  mortgage  to  buy  a  car  or  house,  the  loan
agreement usually states that the car or house is collateral that goes to the lender if the sum isn't paid.

- [[equilateral]] 

 Having all sides or faces equal. 

• On her desk she kept an equilateral prism, through which every morning the sun would project the
colors of the spectrum onto the far wall. 

Since equi- [[means]] “equal” (see EQU), the meaning of equilateral is easy to guess from its roots. The
word  is  mostly  used  in  geometry.  The  standard  polygons  (many-sided  geometrical  shapes)—the
pentagon,  hexagon,  octagon,  etc.—are  assumed  to  be  equilateral  if  we  don't  say  otherwise;  an
equilateral rectangle has the special name square. But triangles are particularly important, and many
triangles  are  not  equal-sided.  The  standard  polyhedrons  (many-sided  solids)  are  also  equilateral.
Most common is the cube, all of whose sides are square. The tetrahedron has four triangular sides and
thus is a pyramid with a triangular base, unlike the pyramids of Egypt with their square bases.
