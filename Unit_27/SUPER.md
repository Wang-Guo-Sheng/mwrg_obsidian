- SUPER,  a  Latin  prefix  meaning  “over,  higher,  more  than,”  has  become  one  of  the  most  familiar
prefixes in English, one of those prefixes that we use to create new words all the time: supermodel,
superpowerful, superjock, supersize, supersweet—the  list  goes  on  and  on.  This  all  seems  to  have
started  in  1903  when  the  playwright  G.  B.  Shaw  translated  the  German  word  Übermensch,
Nietzsche's  famous  term  for  the  person  who  rises  to  heroic  heights  through  discipline  and  creative
power,  in  the  title  of  his  play  Man and Superman.  The  comic-book  character  with  the  same  name
wouldn't make his appearance for another 30 years.

- [[superfluous]] 

 Beyond what is needed; extra. 

• My Freshman Comp professor removes all superfluous words from our essays, and usually ends up
shortening mine by about 40 percent. 

Since the Latin fluere means “to flow” (see FLU), you can think of superfluous as describing a river
with  so  much  water  that  it's  overflowing  its  banks.  The  word  is  used  in  all  kinds  of  contexts.
Superfluous characters in computer code may keep it from working. Most of the buttons on a remote
control may strike us as superfluous, since we never use them. When a situation “speaks for itself,”
any comment may be superfluous. And whenever you yourself are feeling superfluous, as in a “Two's
company, three's a crowd” situation, it's probably time to leave.

- [[insuperable]] 

 Incapable of being solved or overcome. 

•  In  learning  to  speak  again  after  suffering  a  massive  stroke,  he  had  overcome  what  seemed  like
insuperable odds. 

From  its  roots,  the  literal  meaning  of  insuperable  would  be  something  like  “un-get-overable”;
insurmountable  is  a  fairly  exact  synonym.  Insuperable  is  used  to  describe  obstacles,  difficulties,
barriers,  obstructions,  problems,  and  objections.  Americans  love  stories  of  people  who  succeed  in
spite of terrible handicaps, whether as a result of physical limitations, prejudice, poverty, or lack of
opportunity; such rugged spirits may be called indomitable, “incapable of being subdued.”

- [[supersede]] 

 To take the place of; to replace with something newer or more useful. 

•  The  notorious  decision  in  the  Dred  Scott  case  was  superseded  by  the  14th  Amendment  to  the
Constitution, which stated that anyone born in the U.S. had all the rights of a citizen. 

The Latin word supersedere means “sit on top of”—which is one way of taking someone else's place.
Your boss may send around a memo that supersedes the memo she sent the day before (the one with
all the errors in it). Every time the first-class postage rate goes up, the new stamps supersede the old
ones.  In  science,  a  new  theory  often  supersedes  an  older  one;  for  example,  the  theory  that  a
characteristic you acquire during your lifetime can be passed on biologically to your children (called
Lamarckism) was superseded by Darwin's theory of evolution. Watch out when spelling this word;
supersede is practically the only English word that ends in -sede.

- [[superlative]] 

 Supreme, excellent. 

• The new restaurant turned out to be an elegant place, and we all agreed that the food and wine were
superlative. 

Superlative may sound high-flown when compared with a synonym like outstanding, but if your next
paper comes back from your teacher with the comment “Superlative work!” at the top you probably
won't complain. Since superlative means “best, greatest,” it makes sense that superlative  is  also  a
term used in grammar for the highest degree of comparison. So for the adjective simple, for example,
the comparative form is simpler and the superlative form is simplest; and for the adverb boldly, the
comparative form is more boldly and the superlative is most boldly.
