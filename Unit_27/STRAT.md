- STRAT comes from the Latin word stratum, meaning “spread” or “bed.” Strata, a form of the same
word, came to be used by the Romans to mean “paved road”—that is, street.

- [[stratum]] 
society made up of people of the same rank or position. 

 (1) A layer of a substance, especially one of a series of layers. (2) A level of

• Alcohol and drug abuse are found in every stratum of society. 

In geology, a stratum is a layer of rock or soil that is distinct from those above and below it. Rock and
soil strata  (notice  the  plural  form)  can  be  seen  in  road  cuts,  cliffs,  quarries,  riverbanks,  and  sand
dunes,  and  in  pieces  of  limestone,  slate,  and  shale.  Archaeologists  digging  in  historical  sites  are
careful to note the stratum where each artifact is found. Earth scientists divide the earth's atmosphere
into strata, just as oceanographers divide the ocean's depths into strata. And for social scientists, a
stratum is a group of people who are similar in some way, such as education, culture, or income.

- [[stratification]] 
in layers. 

 The process or state of being formed, deposited, or arranged

•  The  stratification  of  the  lake  in  summer  keeps  oxygen-rich  cold  water  at  the  bottom,  where
coldwater fish such as trout take refuge. 

If you look for it, you'll find stratification almost everywhere. On a tall rain-forest tree, there may be
different air plants clinging to it, different insects crawling on it, and different mammals making their
homes  at  different  levels.  The  earth  beneath  you  may  be  stratified  into  several  distinctive  layers
within the first 20 feet. If the wind you're feeling is moving at 10 miles per hour, at 30 feet above your
head  it  may  be  20  mph,  and  in  the  jet  stream  above  that  it  may  be  150  mph.  If  you  climb  a  high
mountain in Himalayas, you may begin in a lush, wet forest and end up in a windswept environment
where not even lichen will grow.

- [[substrate]] 

 (1) An underlying layer. (2) The base on which an organism lives. 

• The soil is the substrate of most seed plants. 

With its Latin prefix sub-, “below” (see SUB), substrate obviously refers to a layer under something
else. Rock may serve as the substrate for the coral in a coral reef. Tiny wafers of silicon (or another
semiconductor) serve as the substrate for computer chips. Substrate may also mean subsoil—that is,
the layer under the topsoil, lacking in organic matter or humus. Substrate is part of the vocabulary of
various  other  sciences,  including  chemistry  and  biology.  But  although  it's  mostly  a  scientific  term,
writers may also use it to mean simply “foundation”—for instance, when observing that reading is the
substrate on which most other learning is based.

- [[stratocumulus]] 
often dark horizontal layers, with tops rounded into large balls or rolls. 

  A  low-lying  cloud  formation  appearing  as  extensive  and

• A dark bank of stratocumulus clouds was moving in quickly, and in March that usually meant bad
weather. 

When  a  cloud  type  forms  a  broad  “layer”  over  the  earth,  the  strat-  root  shows  up  in  its  scientific
name.  The  type  called  simply  stratus  forms  a  low  layer  of  gray  extending  over  a  large  area.
Cirrostratus (“curl layer”) clouds form a high, thin layer often covering the entire sky (but without the
wispy curls of ice crystals that give pure cirrus clouds their name). Altostratus (“high layer”) clouds
form  a  darkish  gray  mid-altitude  layer.  Nimbostratus  (“rainstorm  layer”)  clouds  form  a  low,  dark
layer  of  gray  cloud  that  usually  produces  light  but  continuous  rain,  snow,  or  sleet  (but  not  violent
storms of the kind that give pure nimbus clouds their name). Cumulus (“heap”) is the familiar puffy
fair-weather type of cloud; stratocumulus is its more wintry version, which spreads out in a fairly flat
layer, much less “heaped up,” and sometimes dense enough to cover almost the whole sky.

- LATER comes from the Latin adjective lateralis, meaning “side.” The noun for “side” in Latin was
