- SURG comes from the Latin verb surgere, meaning “to rise, spring up.” Our noun surge  means  “a
sudden,  large  increase,”  and  the  verb  surge  means  “to  move  with  a  surge.”  A  storm  surge  occurs
when  violent  storm  winds  at  sea  cause  the  water  to  pile  up  higher  than  normal  sea  level.  A  surge
protector  keeps  a  spike  in  electrical  current  from  “frying”  your  computer  when  a  lightning  strike
sends a sudden surge down the wires.

- [[upsurge]] 

 A rapid or sudden increase or rise. 

• Almost forgotten for years, at 76 he was offered a colorful role in an odd little film, which brought
an upsurge in interest in his career. 

An upsurge in drug use sometimes leads to an upsurge in crime. An upsurge of flu cases can be cause
for  alarm.  And  an  upsurge  of  fury  at  overpaid  CEOs  might  lead  to  new  legislation  to  restrain  high
salaries. We seem to use upsurge more in negative contexts than in positive ones, but not always; we
usually welcome an upsurge of consumer confidence, an upsurge in new-car sales, or an upsurge in
the stock market.

- [[insurgency]] 
uprising. 

 A usually violent attempt to take control of a government; a rebellion or

• The Mexican press was fascinated by the armed insurgency's mysterious leader, who wore a mask
and went by the name of Subcomandante Marcos. 

Insurgencies  fall  into  the  category  of  “irregular  warfare,”  since  an  insurgency  normally  lacks  the
organization  of  a  revolution,  even  though  it  has  the  same  aims.  Revolutions  often  begin  within  a
country's  armed  forces,  whereas  insurgencies  often  arise  in  remote  areas,  where  they  gain  strength
slowly  by  winning  the  confidence  of  rural  populations.  An  insurgency  may  be  based  on  ethnic  or
religious identity, or its roots may be basically political or economic. Since insurgencies are rarely
strong enough to face a national army head-on, insurgents (often called guerrillas) tend to use such
tactics as bombing, kidnapping, hostage taking, and hijacking.

- [[counterinsurgent]] 
guerrillas or revolutionaries. 

  A  person  taking  military  or  political  action  against

• Counterinsurgents who build trust with the local population will gradually begin to receive useful
information. 

A counterinsurgent is, as you might guess, someone who combats an insurgency. Counterinsurgency
efforts  often  attempt  to  win  the  “hearts  and  minds”  of  a  population  by  hiring  and  paying  local
villagers, opening health clinics and schools, organizing sports programs, and providing agricultural
assistance.  These  terms  were  first  used  to  describe  the  American  effort  to  strengthen  the  South
Vietnamese  government  against  communist  forces  in  the  1960s—an  effort  that  eventually  ended  in
defeat.

- [[resurgent]] 

 Rising again into life, activity, or prominence. 

•  The  country  had  let  down  its  guard  over  the  summer,  and  in  the  fall  a  resurgent  flu  virus
overwhelmed the public-health system, killing tens of thousands. 

Resurgent means literally a “rising again” (see RE). We may speak of a resurgent baseball team, a
resurgent  steel  industry,  the  resurgence  of  jogging,  or  a  resurgence  of  violence  in  a  war  zone.
Resurgence is particularly prominent in its Italian translation, risorgimento. In the 19th century, when
the Italian peninsula consisted of a number of small independent states, a popular movement known as
the Risorgimento managed to unify the peninsula and create the modern state of Italy in 1870.
