- IATR, from the Greek iatros, “healer, physician,” usually hides in the middle of words, where it isn't
immediately noticed. A pediatrician treats children (see PED-). A psychiatrist  is  a  physician  who
treats  mental  problems.  (A  psychologist,  by  contrast,  doesn't  have  a  medical  degree  and  thus  can't
prescribe drugs.) And a physiatrist is a doctor who practices “physical medicine and rehabilitation,”
which  may  involve  such  things  as  testing  various  physical  abilities,  relieving  pain  through  electric
heat or massage, or training patients to exercise or to use an artificial limb.

- [[iatrogenic]] 

 Caused accidentally by medical treatment. 

• Most medical malpractice suits seek compensation for iatrogenic injury. 

In  the  21st  century,  patients  with  throat  infections  are  no  longer  being  bled  to  death  by  misguided
doctors, like the unfortunate George Washington. But iatrogenic injury and death still remain serious
risks. Because of a doctor's bad handwriting, a patient may be given the wrong powerful drug. The
sheer number of drugs on the market has led to dangerous drug interactions, which often occur when
one doctor doesn't know what another is doing. Too many patients go to the hospital for some common
treatment  and  pick  up  an  antibiotic-resistant  staph  infection.  And  let's  not  even  think  about  those
unlucky patients who wake up to find that the surgeon has removed the wrong foot.

- [[bariatric]] 

 Relating to or specializing in the treatment of obesity. 

• In the type of bariatric surgery called gastric bypass, part of the stomach is actually stapled off. 

Baros  means  “weight”  in  Greek;  so,  for  example,  a  barometer  is  an  instrument  that  measures  air
pressure or weight. Bariatric describes the medical treatment of serious overweight—that is, obesity.
Bariatric  surgery  is  only  employed  when  other  methods  of  weight  loss  have  been  tried  and  failed.
Though stapling the stomach may seem extreme, we now know that obesity greatly increases the risk
of heart disease, diabetes, cancer, and stroke, so stomach surgery doesn't just help people look and
feel better—it's a potential lifesaver.

- [[geriatric]] 

 Of or relating to old people. 

•  We  guessed  we  were  now  in  the  hospital's  geriatric  wing,  since  all  the  patients  seemed  to  be
elderly. 

Since most medical care is devoted to those over 65, geriatrics, the medical treatment of the elderly,
is a highly important specialty. The specific problems of the elderly include physical inactivity and
instability,  which  result  from  weakness  and  loss  of  energy.  Weakness  of  the  eyes  and  ears  plays  a
role, and weakening of the immune system often leads to more disease. All these conditions can be
made  worse  by  mental  problems,  such  as  declining  intellectual  activity,  declining  memory,  and
depression, which may prevent the patient from taking action to improve his or her condition. But the
effects of aging can be greatly relieved by proper care. And the greatest improvement often results
when the patient is persuaded to become more physically, mentally, and socially active.

- [[podiatrist]] 

 A doctor who treats injuries and diseases of the foot. 

• Like most podiatrists, she spends a lot of time dealing with minor complaints like bunions, ankle
sprains, arch pain, and hammertoes. 

Most foot problems result from the fact that human feet were never designed to walk on asphalt and
concrete or even to wear shoes (all that cushioning we demand in our shoes may be doing us more
harm  than  good).  So  today  we  have  an  entire  medical  specialty  devoted  to  feet.  In  the  U.S.,  a
podiatrist is a doctor of podiatric medicine (D.P.M.), who is licensed to perform surgery. The root
pod- [[comes]] from the Greek word for “foot” (compare PED).  But  in  England  a  foot  doctor  is  often
called a chiropodist, a term that dates from the time when the same specialist treated hands as well,
since chiro- [[means]] “hand.”
