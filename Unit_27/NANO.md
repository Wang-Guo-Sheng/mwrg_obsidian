NANO comes from the Greek nanos, meaning “dwarf.” For a prefix meaning “small,” English got by
for  centuries  with  the  Greek  micro-,  and  later  mini-  came  to  be  used  widely  as  well.  But  only
recently, as a result of advances in scientific knowledge and technology, has there been a need for a
prefix meaning “extremely small”—a need that's been filled by nano-, which today is being attached
to all kinds of words, sometimes not very seriously (nanoskirt, nano-brained, etc.).

• Nanotechnology is now seen as contributing to numerous environmental solutions, from cleaning up
hazardous waste sites to producing strong but lightweight materials for auto bodies. 

Nanotechnology,  or  nanotech  for  short,  deals  with  matter  at  a  level  that  most  of  us  find  hard  to
imagine,  since  it  involves  objects  with  dimensions  of  100  billionths  of  a  meter  (1/800th  of  the
thickness  of  a  human  hair)  or  less.  The  chemical  and  physical  properties  of  materials  often  change
greatly at this scale. Nanotechnology is already being used in automobile tires, land-mine detectors,
and computer disk drives. Nanomedicine is a particularly exciting field: Imagine particles the size of
a  blood  cell  that  could  be  released  into  the  bloodstream  to  form  into  tiny  robots  and  attack  cancer
cells,  or  “machines”  the  size  of  a  molecule  that  could  actually  repair  the  damaged  interiors  of
individual cells.

- [[nanosecond]] 

 One billionth of a second. 

• When he finally asked if she would marry him, it took her about a nanosecond to say yes. 

The nonserious use of nanosecond is probably much more common than the proper technical use. In
measurement  terms  such  as  nanosecond,  nanogram,  and  nanometer,  nano-  means  “billionth”;  in
other  kinds  of  words,  its  meaning  isn't  quite  so  precise.  In  computers,  the  speed  of  reading  and
writing to random access memory (RAM) is measured in nanoseconds. By comparison, the speed of
reading or writing to a hard drive or a CD-ROM player, or for information to travel over the Internet,
is  measured  in  milliseconds  (thousandths  of  a  second),  which  are  a  million  times  longer  than
nanoseconds.

• In the 1990s the physics department, which had been doing extensive research on microstructures,
began to get deeply involved in nanostructures, including nanofoam, nanoflakes, and nanofibers. 

Two  important  types  of  nanostructure  are  nanocrystals  (tiny  crystals,  often  of  semiconducting
material) and nanotubes (tiny tubes, usually of pure carbon). Nanocrystals made from semiconductors
change color depending on their size, and are being used for such tasks as detecting viruses in living
cells. Nanotubes can conduct enormous amounts of electrical current, far more than metal wires. They
are  the  basic  material  of  tiny  “paper”  batteries,  which  can  be  rolled,  folded,  or  cut  while  still
producing power. Nanotubes are also now being used in materials for lightweight tennis rackets and
golf clubs, and may soon enable the manufacture of TV screens no thicker than a film.

- [[nanoparticle]] 

 A tiny particle whose size is measured in billionths of a meter. 

• Nanoparticles of iron are being used to clean up soil pollution, helping break down molecules of
dangerous substances into simple compounds. 

Nanoparticles of a material usually have very different qualities from those that the material has at its
ordinary scale, which is one reason why there's such excitement about the possibilities for how they
might  be  used  in  future  technologies.  Many  uses  have  already  been  developed.  Aluminum
nanoparticles added to rocket fuel can make the fuel burn twice as fast and release much more energy.
Silicon nanoparticles are increasing the energy efficiency of solar cells by allowing the energy from
ultraviolet light to be captured for the first time. Other nanoparticles are now helping prevent rust in
metals,  produce  stronger  batteries,  enhance  the  diagnosis  of  cancer,  and  improve  the  filtering  of
water, and the number of other applications is growing fast.
