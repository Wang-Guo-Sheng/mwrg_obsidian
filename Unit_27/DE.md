- DE in Latin means “down, away.” So a descent is a downward slope or climb, and a decline is a
downward slide (of health, income, etc.). To devalue something is to take value away from it. And
you might describe a depressed friend as “down.”

- [[debase]] 

 To lower the value or reputation of someone or something. 

• Every year she complains about how Christmas has been debased by commercialism. 

Debase  is  often  used  to  talk  about  someone's  lowered  status  or  character.  People  are  constantly
blustering  about  the  debased  tastes  of  the  ordinary  American,  and  especially  the  debased  music  of
America's  youth.  A  commentator  might  observe  that  both  candidates  had  managed  to  debase
themselves  by  the  end  of  a  political  campaign.  Debase  has  a  special  meaning  in  economics:  From
time to time, governments find that they need to quietly debase their countries' currency by reducing
the percentage of valuable metal in its coins; if they don't, the metal may become more valuable than
the coin and people will begin melting the coins down and reselling the metal.

- [[defamation]] 

 The harming of someone's reputation by libel or slander. 

• In a famous case in 1735, the newspaper publisher J. P. Zenger was found not guilty of defamation
because everything he had printed about the plaintiff was true. 

Harming  someone's  reputation  in  speech  with  falsehoods  is  known  as  slander,  and  doing  the  same
thing in writing is known as libel (which sometimes includes speech as well). Any ordinary citizen
who can claim to have suffered harm as a result of such defamation may sue. So why aren't politicians
suing all the time? Because an exception is made for “public persons” (a category that includes most
other  celebrities  as  well),  who  must  also  prove  that  any  such  statement  was  made  with  “reckless
disregard for the truth.” And although, even by that standard, public persons are defamed all the time,
most of them have decided that it's better to just grin and bear it.

- [[degenerative]] 
to function as time passes. 

 Causing the body or part of the body to become weaker or less able

•  Alzheimer's  is  a  degenerative  disease  of  the  brain,  marked  by  the  decline  of  mental  and  physical
abilities. 

Degenerative  diseases—including  cancer,  glaucoma,  Parkinson's,  diabetes,  arthritis,  and  leprosy—
are  usually  contrasted  with  infectious  diseases  (diseases  caused  by  bacteria,  viruses,  fungi,  and
protozoa). However, many infectious diseases (Lyme disease, AIDS, etc.) can cause a body or body
part  to  degenerate,  and  infective  organisms  play  a  part  in  some  degenerative  diseases.  Some
degenerative diseases can be controlled; some can even be cured. But no one has yet discovered a
way to reverse such degenerative conditions as multiple sclerosis, emphysema, or Alzheimer's.

- [[dejection]] 

 Sadness, depression, or lowness of spirits. 

•  Her  friends  were  puzzled  by  her  frequent  periods  of  dejection,  which  seemed  to  occur  with  no
obvious cause. 

Based partly on the Latin iacere, “to throw” (see JECT), dejection means literally “cast down”—that
is, “downcast.” Like melancholy, gloom, and even sadness, dejection seems to have been declining
in use for many years; instead, we now seem to prefer depression  (whose  roots  mean  basically  “a
pressing down”). Since depression is also the word used by doctors, lots of people now assume that
anyone depressed should be taking an antidepressant; if we went back to dejected and dejection, we
might not be so quick to make that assumption.

- NUL/NULL comes from the Latin word nullus, “none,” which is itself a combination of ne- (“not”)
