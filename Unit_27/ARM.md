- ARM comes from the Latin arma, meaning “weapons, tools.” The root is seen in such English words
as  arms  (i.e.,  weapons),  armed,  and  army.  It  has  nothing  to  do  with  the  limb  that  starts  at  your
shoulder; the name for that kind of arm comes from the Latin word meaning “shoulder.”

- [[armada]] 

 A large group of warships or boats. 

•  The  U.S.  Navy  hopes  to  build  an  electric  armada,  a  new  generation  of  ships  driven  by  electric
power. 

A  Spanish  word  that  originally  meant  simply  “armed,”  armada  is  now  used  in  Spanish-speaking
nations as the name of their national navies. In English, the word usually has historical overtones. The
Great  Armada  of  1588  was  a  120-ship  fleet  sent  by  Philip  II  of  Spain  in  an  attempt  to  invade
Elizabethan England; it was defeated when British forces lit eight ships afire and sent them sailing
into the Armada's midst, then blocked the passage to the south so that the remaining ships were forced
to sail northward around Britain in order to return home, causing dozens more ships to be wrecked in
the stormy northern seas. Today we sometimes use the word humorously for fleets of fishing boats,
rowboats, or canoes.

- [[armistice]] 

 An agreement to stop fighting a war; a truce. 

•  Ambassadors  from  three  neighboring  countries  were  trying  to  arrange  an  armistice  between  the
warring forces. 

Just  as  the  solstice  is  the  time  of  year  when  the  sun  (Latin,  sol)  “stands  still,”  an  armistice  is  an
agreement for armies to stop where they are and lay down their arms. The word is associated with the
truce  that  marked  the  end  of  World  War  I  on  the  Western  Front,  where  the  Allies  had  confronted
Germany,  in  1918.  The  day  of  the  ceasefire,  November  11th  (“the  eleventh  day  of  the  eleventh
month”), was for many years called Armistice Day; today it's known as Veterans Day in the U.S. and
as Remembrance Day in Canada and Australia.

- [[armory]] 

 A place where weapons are made or stored. 

•  The  great  military  rifles  known  as  the  Springfield  30.06  and  the  M1  were  developed  at  the
Springfield Armory in Massachusetts. 

An  armory  has  traditionally  been  a  military  storage  compound  where  machine  guns,  rifles,  pistols,
ammunition, parts, and accessories are kept. In the U.S., National Guard and Reserve units often use
armories  as  training  headquarters  in  peacetime.  Ever  since  George  Washington  established  the
country's  first  armory  in  Springfield  in  1777,  arsenals  and  armories  of  the  Army  Ordnance  Corps
have had a remarkable history of arms manufacture.

- [[disarming]] 

 Tending to remove any feelings of unfriendliness or distrust. 

• All of us at the meeting were charmed by the new manager's disarming openness and modesty. 

A defeated country is sometimes forced to disarm (give up its weapons), and research may be aimed
at disarming a deadly virus (making it incapable of doing damage). But the meaning of the adjective
disarming isn't quite so physical. If you say your nephew has a disarming smile, you mean that his
smile's  warmth  and  genuineness  disarm  the  people  he  meets  of  any  possible  suspicion  or  criticism
and of any verbal weapons they might have used against him.

- SURG comes from the Latin verb surgere, meaning “to rise, spring up.” Our noun surge  means  “a
