- TOM comes from the Greek root meaning “cut.” Thus, the Latin word anatomia, from which we get
anatomy,  means  “dissection”—that  is  cutting  or  separating  the  parts  of  an  organism  for  detailed
examination. In a lobotomy, the nerves linking a brain lobe to the rest of the brain are removed; even
though  lobotomies  have  hardly  been  performed  in  the  last  50  years,  the  idea  can  still  fill  us  with
horror.

- [[appendectomy]] 

 Surgical removal of the human appendix. 

•  Appendectomy  is  an  emergency  procedure,  since  appendicitis  can  be  fatal  if  its  symptoms  are
ignored. 

The  appendix  is  a  tiny  tube  attached  to  the  large  intestine  that  no  longer  has  any  real  function.
Appendicitis—inflammation and swelling of the appendix, usually as a result of bacterial infection—
generally  occurs  between  the  ages  of  10  and  19,  and  is  the  most  common  reason  for  emergency
surgery  in  the  U.S.  today.  Since  the  appendix  has  so  little  to  do,  appendectomies  normally  have  no
negative aftereffects at all. If appendicitis is ignored, bacteria may enter the blood and infect other
parts of the body.

- [[gastrectomy]] 

 Surgical removal of all or part of the stomach. 

•  Gastrectomy  is  used  to  treat  holes  in  the  stomach  wall,  noncancerous  tumors,  and  cancer,  but  is
performed only when other treatments have been rejected. 

Gastr-  comes  from  the  Greek  word  for  “belly,”  and  shows  up  in  English  in  such  words  as  gastric
(“relating to the stomach”) and gastronomy (“the cooking and eating of fine food”). Believe it or not,
there are many people today who have had a gastrectomy and live without a stomach; some of them
need to eat fairly steadily and carefully through the day, but many lead almost completely normal and
even vigorous lives.

- [[tonsillectomy]] 

 Surgical removal of the tonsils. 

•  His  daughter's  usual  doctor  thought  antibiotics  could  cure  her  swollen  tonsils,  but  a  specialist
recommended tonsillectomy. 

The tonsils are the areas of tissue that you can see in the mirror on both sides of your throat (not to be
confused with the uvula, which hangs down in the middle). Tonsillectomy, the most common surgery
performed  on  children  in  the  U.S.,  is  intended  to  relieve  tonsillitis,  or  inflammation  of  the  tonsils
(usually by strep or staph bacteria). But the fact is, tonsillitis can often be successfully treated with
antibiotics, which means that surgery, including the week or two of pain and discomfort that follows
it, is generally unnecessary.

- [[mastectomy]] 

 Surgical removal of all or part of the breast. 

• She has always dreaded being disfigured by mastectomy, but her talks with the surgeon have calmed
her considerably. 

Breast cancer is the most common cancer among American women. Early cases can often be treated
with  drugs  or  with  a  small  operation  called  a  lumpectomy  (because  it  removes  a  lump).  Though  a
“simple  mastectomy”  is  larger  than  a  lumpectomy,  it  allows  the  breast  to  be  reconstructed,  using
artificial implants or tissue from elsewhere on the body. But “radical mastectomy,” which is required
when  the  cancer  is  at  an  advanced  stage,  takes  much  of  the  chest  muscle  and  makes  reconstruction
impossible.
