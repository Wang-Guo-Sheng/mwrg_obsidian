- NUL/NULL comes from the Latin word nullus, “none,” which is itself a combination of ne- (“not”)
and ullus (“any”). Have you ever noticed how many of our negative words start with n-? Think of no,
not, never, nothing, none, no one, nowhere, and the hundreds of non- [[words]]—just about all of which
go back to the same Greek root.

- [[null]] 

 (1) Having no legal power; invalid. (2) Having no elements. 

• If we can prove that you signed the contract because you were being physically threatened, it will
automatically be declared null. 

Null is used mostly by lawyers, mathematicians, and computer programmers. In law, it usually occurs
in  the  phrase  “null  and  void”  (which  means  about  the  same  thing  as  null  itself).  When  one  of  the
parties that has signed a contract doesn't hold up his or her part of the deal—for example, if a contract
states that a supplier must supply a million screws of a certain quality of steel, and it turns out the
screws supplied were of inferior steel—the other company can refuse to pay anything, claiming the
contract is null and void. In mathematics, null  means  “lacking  any  elements”;  a  null set  is  a  set  of
figures that's actually empty. In computer programming, a null is a character that doesn't actually show
up  as  a  character,  but  instead  may  just  be  required  to  show  that  a  series  of  digits  or  characters  is
finished.

- [[nullity]] 

 (1) Nothingness. (2) A mere nothing. 

•  He  couldn't  believe  she'd  actually  left  him  for  that  nullity—a  guy  with  no  style,  no  drive,  no
personality at all. 

Intellectuals may speak of a book or a film as a nullity, claiming it possesses nothing original enough
to justify its existence. Legal scholars also use the word; a law passed by a legislature may be called
a nullity if, for example, it's so obviously unconstitutional that it's going to be shot down by the courts
in no time. And if you're in an unkind mood, you're also free to call a person a nullity, if you're not
instead calling him a nobody, a nonentity, or a zero.

- [[nullify]] 

 (1) To cancel legally. (2) To cause something to lose its value or to have no effect. 

• In soccer or water polo, a penalty can nullify a goal that has just been made. 

A legislature may nullify a ban, a law, or a tax by simply passing a new law. Election results can be
nullified  if  a  court  finds  the  voting  process  was  improper,  and  a  court  ruling  can  be  nullified  by  a
higher court. Even the Supreme Court itself may have its decisions nullified by new laws passed by
the  Congress—though  not  if  a  decision  is  based  on  the  Constitution.  In  the  years  leading  up  to  the
American Civil War, Southern states claimed the right to nullify any federal law (such as antislavery
laws) that they believed to be unconstitutional, leading to the Nullification Crisis of 1832. Annul is a
close synonym of nullify (with the same root), as are abrogate and invalidate.

- [[annulment]] 

 An official statement that something is no longer valid. 

• He requested an annulment of the marriage from the Church, but his wife claimed that, after 15 years
and two children, the idea of annulment was ridiculous. 

Annulment  usually  applies  to  marriage.  In  some  states  an  annulment  may  be  carried  out  by  a  court
(“judicial annulment”), but annulment is generally practiced by a church (“ecclesiastic annulment”),
and principally the Roman Catholic Church, which traditionally hasn't permitted divorce. The usual
acceptable reason for annulment is a “failure to consummate” the marriage by having children. Unlike
a  marriage  that  ends  in  divorce,  an  annulled  marriage  is  considered  never  to  have  existed.  Other
things can be annulled as well, including a contract (if one party fails to comply with its terms) or an
election (if it wasn't carried out properly).
