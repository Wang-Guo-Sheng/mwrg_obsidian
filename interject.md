插嘴

To interrupt a conversation with a comment or remark. 

• His anger was growing as he listened to the conversation, and every so often he would interject a
crude comment. 

According  to  its  Latin  roots,  interject  ought  to  mean  literally  “throw  between.”  For  most  of  the word's  history,  however,  the  only  things  that  have  been  interjected  have  been  comments  dropped suddenly into a conversation. [[interjection|Interjections]] are often humorous, and sometimes even insulting, and the best interjections are so quick that the conversation isn't even interrupted.
