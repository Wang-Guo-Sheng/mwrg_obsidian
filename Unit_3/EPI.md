- EPI is a Greek prefix that may mean various things, but usually “on, over” or “attached to.” So an
earthquake's epicenter  is  the  ground  right  over  the  center  of  the  quake.  And  your  epidermis  is  the
outer layer of your skin, on top of the inner dermis.

- [[epilogue]] 

 The final section after the main part of a book or play. 

• Her editor told her the book really needed an epilogue, to tell where each member of the family is
today. 

From  its  Greek  roots,  epilogue  means  basically  “words  attached  (at  the  end).”  An  epilogue  often
somehow wraps up a story's action, as in the one for a famous Shakespeare play that ends, “For never
was a story of more woe / Than this of Juliet and her Romeo.” In nonfiction books, we now often use
the term afterword instead of epilogue, just as we now generally use foreword instead of prologue
(see LOG). Movies also often have a kind of epilogue—maybe a scene after the exciting climax when
the surviving lovers meet in a café to talk about their future. The epilogue of a musical composition,
after all the drama is over, is called the coda (Italian for “tail”).

- [[epiphyte]] 
another plant for support. 

 A plant that obtains its nutrients from the air and the rain and usually grows on

• The strangler fig begins life as an epiphyte on a tree branch, drops its tendrils to take root in the
ground around the trunk, and slowly covers and strangles the tree to death. 

Epiphytic  plants  are  sometimes  known  as  “air  plants”  because  they  seemingly  survive  on  thin  air.
They  rely  on  their  host  plants  merely  for  physical  support,  not  nourishment.  Tropical  epiphytes
include  orchids,  ferns,  and  members  of  the  pineapple  family.  To  a  newcomer  in  the  tropical  rain
forest, the first sight of a great tree with large epiphytes hanging from every level can be eerie and
astonishing. Familiar epiphytes of the temperate zone include lichens, mosses, and algae, which may
grow on rocks or water without touching the soil.

- [[epitaph]] 

 An inscription on a grave or tomb in memory of the one buried there. 

• The great architect Christopher Wren designed London's majestic St. Paul's Cathedral, the site of his
tomb and epitaph: “Si monumentum requiris, circumspice” (“If you seek my monument, look around
you”). 

Epitaph includes the root from the Greek word taphos, “tomb” or “funeral.” Traditionally, epitaph
refers to a tombstone inscription, but it can also refer to brief memorial statements that resemble such
inscriptions.  One  of  the  most  famous  is  Henry  Lee's  epitaph  for  George  Washington:  “First  in  war,
first in peace, and first in the hearts of his countrymen.”

- [[epithet]] 
person or thing. (2) An insulting or demeaning word or phrase. 

 (1) A descriptive word or phrase occurring with or in place of the name of a

• King Richard I of England earned the epithet “Lionhearted,” while his brother, King John, was given
the epithet “Lackland.” 

From its Greek roots, epithet would mean something “put on,” or added. Sometimes the added name
follows  a  given  name,  as  in  Erik  the  Red  or  Billy  the  Kid.  In  other  cases,  the  epithet  precedes  the
personal name, as in Mahatma (“Great-souled”) Gandhi. In still others, it's used in place of the actual
name, as in El Greco (“The Greek”) or El Cid (“The Lord”). In its other common meaning, an epithet
is a mocking or insulting name (like “Lackland” in the example sentence). When enemies are said to
be “hurling epithets” at each other, it means they're exchanging angry insults.
