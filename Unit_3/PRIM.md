- PRIM  comes  from  primus,  the  Latin  word  for  “first.”  Something  primary  is  first  in  time,  rank,  or
importance. Something primitive is in its first stage of development. And something primeval had its
origin in the first period of world or human history.

 Basic or primitive. 

• There was always a primal pleasure in listening to the rain beat on the roof at night and dropping off
to sleep in front of the fire. 

Primal  generally  describes  something  powerful  and  almost  instinctual.  So  when  we  speak  of  the
primal  innocence  of  youth  or  the  primal  intensity  of  someone's  devotion,  we're  suggesting  that  the
emotions or conditions being described are basic to our animal nature. Sitting around a campfire may
feel like a primal experience, in which we share the emotions of our cave-dwelling ancestors. Intense
fear  of  snakes  or  spiders  may  have  primal  roots,  owing  to  the  poison  that  some  species  carry.  In
“primal  scream”  therapy,  popular  in  the  1970s,  patients  relive  painful  childhood  experiences  and
express their frustration and anger through uncontrolled screaming and even violence.

• She announced that she'd be passing out a primer on mutual funds at the end of the talk. 

Primers  were  once  a  standard  part  of  every  child's  education.  The  first  primer  printed  in  North
America, The New England Primer (ca. 1690), was typical; it contained many quotations from the
Bible and many moral lessons, and the text was accompanied by numerous woodcut illustrations. We
no  longer  use  the  word  in  early  education,  but  it's  widely  used  in  everyday  speech.  Notice  how
primer is pronounced; don't mix it up with the kind of paint that's pronounced with a long i sound.

- [[primate]] 
monkeys. 

  Any  member  of  the  group  of  animals  that  includes  human  beings,  apes,  and

•  Dr.  Leakey  sent  three  young  women  to  work  with  individual  primates:  Jane  Goodall  with  the
chimpanzees, Dian Fossey with the gorillas, and Birute Galdakis with the orangutans. 

It was the great biologist Carolus Linnaeus who gave the primates their name, to indicate that animals
of this order were the most advanced of all. Linnaeus listed human beings with the apes a hundred
years before Charles Darwin would publish his famous work on evolution. When people told him that
our close relationship to the apes and monkeys was impossible because it disagreed with the Bible,
he responded that, from the biological evidence, he simply couldn't come to a different conclusion.
Among the mammals, the primates are distinguished by their large brains, weak sense of smell, lack
of  claws,  long  pregnancies,  and  long  childhoods,  among  other  things.  Along  with  the  apes  and
monkey,  the  Primate  order  includes  such  interesting  animals  as  the  lemurs,  tarsiers,  galagos,  and
lorises.

• Many astronomers think the universe is continuing to evolve from a primordial cloud of gas. 

Primordial can be traced back to the Latin word primordium, or “origin,” and applies to something
that is only the starting point in a course of development or progression. A primordial landscape is
one that bears no sign of human use, and a primordial cell is the first formed and least specialized in a
line  of  cells.  The  substance  out  of  which  the  earth  was  formed  and  from  which  all  life  evolved  is
commonly called “the primordial ooze” or “the primordial soup”—even by scientists.
