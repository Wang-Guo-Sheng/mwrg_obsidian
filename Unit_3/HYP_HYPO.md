- HYP/HYPO  is  a  Greek  prefix  meaning  “below,  under.”  Many  hypo-  words  are  medical.  A
hypodermic  needle  injects  medication  under  the  skin.  Hypotension,  or  low  blood  pressure,  can  be
just as unhealthy as the better-known hypertension, or high blood pressure.

- [[hypochondriac]] 
often suffers from delusions of physical disease. 

  A  person  overly  concerned  with  his  or  her  own  health  who

• Hercule Poirot, the detective hero of the Agatha Christie mysteries, is a notorious hypochondriac,
always trying to protect himself from drafts. 

One disease a hypochondriac really does suffer from is hypochondria, the anxiety and depression that
come  from  worrying  too  much  about  one's  own  health.  Even  though  it's  easy  to  joke  about
hypochondriacs, hypochondria is no joking matter for the sufferer. Somewhat surprisingly, the second
part  of  hypochondria  derives  from  chondros,  the  Greek  word  for  “cartilage.”  The  cartilage  in
question  is  that  of  the  sternum,  or  breastbone.  From  ancient  times,  doctors  believed  that  certain
internal organs or regions were the seat of various diseases, both physical and mental, and the area
under the breastbone was thought to be the source of hypochondria.

- [[hypoglycemia]] 

 Abnormal decrease of sugar in the blood. 

•  She  had  been  controlling  her  hypoglycemia  through  diet  and  vitamins,  but  she  now  realized  she
needed to add daily exercise as well. 

The root glyk- [[means]] “sweet” in Greek, so glyc shows up in the names of various terms referring to a
sugar  as  a  chemical  ingredient,  such  as  glycerine  and  monoglyceride.  People  with  diabetes  have
difficulty controlling the sugar in their blood. Too little can be dangerous; its early symptoms may be
as  minor  as  nervousness,  shaking,  and  sweating,  but  it  can  lead  to  seizures  and  unconsciousness.
Luckily,  it  can  be  taken  care  of  easily  by  eating  or  drinking  something  high  in  carbohydrates.  Its
opposite,  hyperglycemia  (see  HYPER),  is  the  main  symptom  of  diabetes,  and  usually  requires  an
injection of insulin, which the sufferer usually gives himself. Today many people—though not doctors
—use  hypoglycemia  to  mean  a  completely  different  condition,  with  some  of  the  same  milder
symptoms, that doesn't involve low blood sugar.

- [[hypothermia]] 

 Subnormal temperature of the body. 

• By the time rescuers were able to pull the boy from the pond's icy waters, hypothermia had reached
a life-threatening stage. 

Hypothermia, which usually results from submersion in icy water or prolonged exposure to cold, may
constitute a grave medical emergency. It begins to be a concern when body temperature dips below
95°F, and the pulse, breathing, and blood pressure start to decline. Below 90°, the point at which the
normal reaction of shivering ceases, emergency treatment is called for.

- [[hypothetical]] 
further study or investigation. (2) Imagined for purposes of example. 

 (1) Involving an assumption made for the sake of argument or for

• The candidate refused to say what she would do if faced with a hypothetical military crisis. 

The noun hypothesis  comes  straight  from  the  Greek  word  meaning  “foundation”  or  “base”—that  is
something “put under” something else. So a hypothesis is something you assume to be true in order
that you can use it as the base or basis for a line of reasoning—and any such assumption can be called
hypothetical. So, for example, the theory that the dinosaurs became extinct because of a giant meteor
that struck the earth near the Yucatán Peninsula involves the hypothesis that such a collision would
have had such terrible effects on the earth's climate that the great reptiles would have been doomed.
Once  a  hypothesis  has  been  thoroughly  studied  and  researched  without  being  proved  wrong,  it
generally comes to be called a theory instead.

- THERM/THERMO  comes  from  the  Greek  word  meaning  “warm.”  A  thermometer  measures  the
