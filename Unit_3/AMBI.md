AMBI  means  “on  both  sides”  or  “around”;  ambi-  comes  from  Latin.  Most  of  us  are  either  right-
handed or left-handed, but ambidextrous people can use their right and left hand equally well.

(2) Unclear in meaning because of being understandable in more than one way. 

 (1) Doubtful or uncertain especially from being obscure or indistinct.

• Successful politicians are good at giving ambiguous answers to questions on difficult issues. 

Ambiguous comes from the Latin verb ambigere,  “to  be  undecided.”  When  we  say  someone's  eyes
are  an  ambiguous  color,  we  mean  we  cannot  decide  which  color  they  are—blue  or  green?  The
ambiguity of the Mona Lisa's smile makes us wonder what she's thinking about. An ambiguous order
is one that can be taken in at least two ways; on the other hand, the order “Shut up!” may be rude but
at least it's unambiguous.

- [[ambient]] 

 Existing or present on all sides. 

• The ambient lighting in the restaurant was low, and there was a bright candle at each table. 

Ambient  light  is  the  light  that  fills  an  area  or  surrounds  something  that's  being  viewed,  like  a
television screen or a painting. Scientists sometimes refer to the ambient temperature, the temperature
of the surrounding air. “Ambient music” is the term used today for “atmospheric” background music
usually  intended  for  relaxation  or  meditation.  The  candlelit  restaurant  in  the  example  sentence  is
probably trying for a romantic ambience, or “atmosphere.”

- [[ambivalent]] 
  (1)  Holding  opposite  feelings  and  attitudes  at  the  same  time  toward
someone or something. (2) Continually wavering between opposites or alternative courses of action. 

• He was ambivalent about the trip: he badly wanted to travel but hated to miss the summer activities
at home. 

Ambivalent is a fairly new word, less than a hundred years old, and, not surprisingly, it was first used
by psychologists. Since being ambivalent means simply having mixed feelings about some question or
issue, some of us spend most of our lives in a state of ambivalence. We might feel ambivalence about
accepting a high-paying job that requires us to work long hours, about lending money to someone we
like but don't know well—or about ordering a Tutti-Frutti Chocolate Banana Sundae El Supremo after
we've been starving on a strict diet for weeks.

- [[ambit]] 

 The range or limit covered by something (such as a law). 

• The treatment of farm animals generally falls outside the ambit of animal-cruelty laws in the U.S. 

Ambit is a rather formal term, often used by lawyers, as in, “With this new legislation, tobacco now
falls within the ambit of FDA regulation.” It almost always refers to something abstract rather than an
actual  physical  range.  So,  for  example,  an  immigrant  might  live  completely  within  the  ambit  of  her
immigrant community until she started college, where she might find herself in a much broader social
ambit. Most of the Latin American colonies were established by Spain, but in the 19th century, as the
U.S. became stronger and Spain became weaker, they began to enter the ambit of U.S. power.

- EPI is a Greek prefix that may mean various things, but usually “on, over” or “attached to.” So an
