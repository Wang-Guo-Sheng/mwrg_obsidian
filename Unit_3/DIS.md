- DIS  comes  from  Latin,  where  it  means  “apart.”  In  English,  its  meanings  have  increased  to  include
“opposite”  or  “not”  (as  in  distaste,  disagreeable),  “deprive  of”  (disinfect),  or  “exclude  or  expel
from” (disbar).  The  original  meaning  can  still  be  seen  in  a  word  like  dissipate,  which  means  “to
break up and scatter.”

- [[dissuade]] 

 To convince (someone) not to do something. 

• The thought of the danger he might be facing on the journey makes her uneasy, and she's trying to
dissuade him from going. 

Dissuade is the opposite of persuade, though it's a less common word. The dissuading may be done
by a person or by something else: A bad weather forecast may dissuade a fisherman from going out to
sea that day, but a warning on a cigarette pack almost never dissuades a real smoker from having his
or her next cigarette.

- [[disorient]] 

 To cause to be confused or lost. 

• By now the hikers were completely disoriented, and darkness was falling fast. 

The Orient is the East (just as the Occident is the West). The verb orient comes from the traditional
practice  of  building  Christian  churches  so  that  the  altar  is  at  the  building's  easterly  end—in  other
words, “orienting” the church. One reason for this practice is that the Book of Matthew says, “As the
lightning  comes  from  the  East  .  .  .  so  also  will  the  Son  of  Man”—that  is,  just  like  the  sun  in  the
morning,  Jesus  in  his  Second  Coming  will  appear  in  the  East.  Orienteering  is  participating  in  a
cross-country  race  in  which  each  person  uses  a  map  and  compass  to  navigate  the  course.  Orient
comes from the word meaning “to rise” (like the sun), and still today it's easy for a hiker to become
disoriented when an overcast sky hides the sun.

- [[discredit]] 
damage the reputation of (someone). 

  (1)  To  cause  (someone  or  something)  to  seem  dishonest  or  untrue.  (2)  To

• His book had been thoroughly discredited by scholars, and his reputation was badly damaged. 

Since one meaning of credit is “trust,” discredit  means  basically  “destroy  one's  trust.”  A  scientific
study may be discredited if it turns out it was secretly written up by someone paid by a drug company.
An autobiography may be discredited if someone discovers that the best parts came out of a novel. A
lawyer  may  try  to  discredit  testimony  in  a  trial  by  revealing  that  the  witness  just  got  out  of  the
slammer. Many political campaigns rely on discrediting one's opponents; desperate politicians have
learned that, if they can claim that someone attacking them has been completely discredited, it might
work even if it isn't true.

- [[dislodge]] 

 To force out of a place, especially a place of rest, hiding, or defense. 

• Senators are attempting to dislodge the bill from the committee, where the chairman has failed to act
on it for five months. 

A  lodge  is  usually  a  kind  of  roominghouse  or  hotel,  and  the  verb  lodge  often  means  staying  or
sleeping  in  such  a  place.  Thus,  dislodge  means  removing  a  person  or  thing  from  where  it's  been
staying. So, for instance, you might use a toothpick to dislodge a seed from between your teeth, police
might use tear gas to dislodge a sniper from his hiding place, and a slate tile dislodged from a roof
could be dangerous to someone hanging out on the street below.

- Latin Borrowings

ad hoc 

 Formed or used for a particular purpose or for immediate needs. 

•  The  faculty  formed  an  ad  hoc  committee  to  deal  with  the  question  of  First  Amendment  rights  on
campus. 

Ad hoc literally means “for this” in Latin, and in English this almost always means “for this specific
purpose.” Issues that come up in the course of a project often require immediate, ad hoc solutions. An
ad hoc investigating committee is authorized to look into a matter of limited scope. An ad hoc ruling
by an athletic council is intended to settle a particular case, and is not meant to serve as a model for
later rulings. If an organization deals with too many things on an ad hoc basis, it may mean someone
hasn't been doing enough planning.

- [[ad]] hominem 
answer to the arguments made or the issues raised. 

 Marked by an attack on an opponent's character rather than by an

• Presidential campaigns have often relied on ad hominem attacks rather than serious discussion of
important issues. 

Ad hominem in Latin means “to the man”—that is, “against the other person.” The term comes from
the field of rhetoric (the art of speaking and writing). If you have a weak argument, one easy way to
defend  yourself  has  always  been  to  attack  your  opponent  verbally  in  a  personal  way.  Since  such
attacks require neither truth nor logic to be effective, their popularity has never waned.

- [[alter]] ego 
personality. 

 (1) A trusted friend or personal representative. (2) The opposite side of a

• The White House chief of staff is a political alter ego, who knows, or should know, who and what
the President considers most important. 

In Latin, alter ego literally means “second I.” An alter ego can be thought of as a person's clone or
second self. A professional alter ego might be a trusted aide who knows exactly what the boss wants
done. A personal alter ego might be a close friend who is almost like a twin. Alter ego can also refer
to the second, hidden side of one's own self. In Robert Louis Stevenson's classic The Strange Case of
Doctor Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, Dr. Jekyll is a good-hearted, honorable man; but after taking a potion,
his alter ego, the loathsome and diabolical Mr. Hyde, takes over his personality.

- [[de]] facto 

 Being such in practice or effect, although not formally recognized; actual. 

• Although there was never a general declaration of war, the two countries were at war in a de facto
sense for almost a decade. 

Literally meaning “from the fact,” de facto in English can be applied to anything that has the substance
of  something  without  its  formal  name.  A  de  facto  government  is  one  that  operates  with  all  of  the
power of a regular government but without official recognition. De facto segregation isn't the result of
laws, but can be just as real and deep-rooted as legally enforced segregation. The de facto leader of a
group is just the one who all the rest seem to follow. (Compare de jure.)

- [[quid]] pro quo 

 Something given or received for something else. 

• He did something very nice for me years ago, so getting him that job was really a quid pro quo. 

In Latin, quid pro quo means literally “something for something.” Originally, the phrase was used to
mean the substitution of an inferior medicine for a good one. Today it often doesn't suggest anything
negative; for most people, it just means “a favor for a favor.” But in politics the phrase is often used
when, for example, a wealthy corporation gives a lot of money to a candidate and expects to get a big
favor in return. In such cases, some of us may prefer to describe the money as a bribe and the quid
pro quo as a payoff.

- [[ex]] post facto 

 Done, made, or formulated after the fact. 

• When Carl tells us his “reasons” for why he behaved badly, they're nothing but ex post facto excuses
for impulsive behavior. 

Ex post facto is Latin for “from a thing done afterward.” Approval for a project that's given ex post
facto—after the project already has been begun or completed—may just have been given in order to
save face. An ex post facto law is one that declares someone's action to be criminal only after it was
committed—a procedure forbidden by our Constitution.

- [[modus]] operandi 

 A usual way of doing something. 

• A criminal who commits repeated crimes can often be identified by his modus operandi. 

Modus operandi is Latin for “method of operating.” The term is often associated with police work,
and it's a favorite of mystery writers. In speech and dialogue, it's often abbreviated to “m.o.” (as in
“We're beginning to get a handle on the killer's m.o., but we can't go public with it yet”). But it's not
only  used  in  criminal  contexts.  So  a  frequent  gambler  who  likes  to  play  the  horses  may  have  a
particular  modus  operandi  for  picking  winners.  And  the  familiar  modus  operandi  of  a  cutthroat
retailer may be to undersell competitors, drive them out of business, and then raise prices afterwards.

- [[modus]] vivendi 
to all concerned. (2) A way of life. 

 (1) A practical compromise or arrangement that is acceptable

• During the budget crisis, the Democratic governor and the Republican legislature established a good
working modus vivendi. 

Modus  vivendi  literally  means  “manner  of  living”  in  Latin,  and  it  sometimes  has  that  meaning  in
English as well. Usually, though, a modus vivendi is a working arrangement that disputing parties can
live  with,  at  least  until  a  more  permanent  solution  can  be  found.  Typically,  a  modus  vivendi  is  an
arrangement  that  ignores  differences  and  difficulties.  So,  for  example,  two  people  going  through  a
bitter  divorce  may  be  able  to  arrive  at  a  modus  vivendi  that  allows  them  to  at  least  maintain  an
appearance of civility and dignity.
