- HOM/HOMO  comes  from  homos,  the  Greek  word  for  “same,”  which  in  English  words  may  also
mean  “similar.”  A  homograph  is  a  word  spelled  like  another  word  but  different  in  meaning  or
pronunciation,  and  a  homosexual  is  a  person  who  favors  others  of  the  same  sex.  (This  root  has
nothing to do with the Latin homo, meaning “person,” as in Homo sapiens, the French homme, and the
Spanish hombre.)

- [[homonym]] 
in meaning. 

 One of two or more words pronounced and/or spelled alike but different

• The pool of “a pool of water” and the pool of “a game of pool” are homonyms. 

Homonym can be troublesome because it may refer to three distinct classes of words. Homonyms may
be words with identical pronunciations but different spellings and meanings, such as to, too, and two.
Or  they  may  be  words  with  both  identical  pronunciations  and  identical  spellings  but  different
meanings, such as quail (the bird) and quail (to cringe). Finally, they may be words that are spelled
alike but are different in pronunciation and meaning, such as the bow of a ship and bow that shoots
arrows. The first and second types are sometimes called homophones, and the second and third types
are  sometimes  called  homographs—which  makes  naming  the  second  type  a  bit  confusing.  Some
language scholars prefer to limit homonym to the third type.

- [[homogeneous]] 
composition throughout. 

  (1)  Of  the  same  or  a  similar  kind.  (2)  Of  uniform  structure  or

• Though she was raised in a small town, she found the city more interesting because its population
was less homogeneous. 

A slab of rock is homogeneous if it consists of the same material throughout, like granite or marble. A
neighborhood might be called homogeneous if all the people in it are similar, having pretty much the
same background, education, and outlook. Homogeneity is fine in a rock, though some people find it a
little  boring  in  a  neighborhood  (while  others  find  it  comforting).  Note  that  many  people  spell  this
word homogenous, and pronounce it that way too.

- [[homologous]] 

 Developing from the same or a similar part of a remote ancestor. 

• Arms and wings are homologous structures that reveal the ancient relationship between birds and
four-legged animals. 

In his famous discussion of the panda's thumb, Stephen Jay Gould carefully explains how this thumb is
not  homologous  to  the  human  thumb.  Although  the  two  digits  are  used  in  much  the  same  way  (the
panda's thumb is essential for stripping bamboo of its tasty leaves, the staple of the panda's diet), the
panda's thumb developed from a bone in its wrist and is an addition to the five “fingers” of its paw.
The tiny stirrup and anvil bones of our inner ear, however, do seem to be homologous with the bones
that allow a garter snake to swallow a frog whole.

- [[homogenize]] 
floating on top. (2) To change (something) so that its parts are the same or similar. 

  (1)  To  treat  (milk)  so  that  the  fat  is  mixed  throughout  instead  of

• By now the suburb had gotten so homogenized that he couldn't tell the families on his street apart. 

Homogenized  milk  has  been  around  so  long—about  a  hundred  years—that  many  Americans  have
never  seen  milk  with  the  cream  on  top,  and  probably  think  cream  separation  only  happens  in
expensive yogurt. But homogenize was being used before anyone succeeded in getting milk and cream
to mix. People who use the word often dislike the idea that everything is becoming the same, whether
it's  radio  shows  that  are  no  longer  produced  locally  or  schools  that  rely  too  much  on  standardized
testing.

- DIS  comes  from  Latin,  where  it  means  “apart.”  In  English,  its  meanings  have  increased  to  include
