- THERM/THERMO  comes  from  the  Greek  word  meaning  “warm.”  A  thermometer  measures  the
amount of warmth in a body, the air, or an oven. A thermostat makes sure the temperature stays at the
same level. And it's easy to see why the German manufacturers of a vacuum-insulated bottle back in
1904 gave it the name Thermos.

- [[thermal]] 
body heat. 

 (1) Of, relating to, or caused by heat. (2) Designed to insulate in order to retain

• A special weave called thermal weave traps insulating air in little pockets to increase the warmth of
long underwear and blankets. 

In days gone by, much of the male population of the northern states in the cold months would wear a
garment  of  thermal  underwear  covering  the  entire  body,  called  a  union  suit.  Union  suits  kept
sodbusters, cowboys, and townsfolk alike not only warm but also itchy and a little on the smelly side
(back  when  bathing  once  a  week  was  considered  the  height  of  cleanliness).  Thermal  imaging  is
photography  that  captures  “heat  pictures”—rather  than  ordinary  light  pictures—of  objects.  And
thermal  pollution  occurs  when  industrial  water  use  ends  up  warming  a  river  in  a  damaging  way.
Small-plane pilots use thermal as a noun for a warm updraft, often over a plowed field or desert, that
lifts their wings, just as it enables hawks to soar upward without moving their wings.

- [[thermodynamics]] 
relations of heat. 

  Physics  that  deals  with  the  mechanical  actions  or

• With his college major in electrical engineering, he assumed it would be an easy step to a graduate-
school concentration in thermodynamics. 

Thermodynamics  (see  DYNAM)  is  based  on  the  fact  that  all  forms  of  energy,  including  heat  and
mechanical energy, are basically the same. Thus, it deals with the ways in which one form of energy
is  converted  into  another,  when  one  of  the  forms  is  heat.  The  study  of  thermodynamics  dates  from
before the invention of the first practical steam engine—an engine that uses steam to produce physical
power—in the 18th century. Today most of the world's electrical power is actually produced by steam
engines, and the principal use of thermodynamics is in power production.

- [[thermonuclear]] 
atomic weight, such as hydrogen, that require a very high temperature to begin. 

 Of or relating to the changes in the nucleus of atoms with low

• In the 1950s and '60s, anxious American families built thousands of underground “fallout shelters”
to protect themselves from the radiation of a thermonuclear blast. 

Nuclear  is  the  adjective  for  nucleus,  the  main  central  part  of  an  atom.  The  original  nuclear
explosives,  detonated  in  1945,  were  so-called  fission  bombs,  since  they  relied  on  the  fission,  or
splitting,  of  the  nuclei  of  uranium  atoms.  But  an  even  greater  source  of  destructive  power  lay  in
nuclear fusion, the forcing together of atomic nuclei. The light and heat given off by stars such as the
sun  come  from  a  sustained  fusion—or  thermonuclear—reaction  deep  within  it.  On  earth,  such
thermonuclear reactions were used to develop the hydrogen bomb, a bomb based on a fusion reaction
that merged hydrogen atoms to become helium atoms. The thermonuclear era, which began in 1952,
produced bombs hundreds of times more powerful than those exploded at the end of World War II.
Why the thermo- [[in]] thermonuclear? Because great heat is required to trigger the fusion process, and
the trigger used is actually a fission bomb.

- British thermal unit The quantity of heat required to raise the temperature of one pound of water one
degree Fahrenheit at a specified temperature. 

•  Wood-stove  manufacturers  compete  with  each  other  in  their  claims  of  how  many  British  thermal
units of heat output their stoves can produce. 

Despite its name, the British thermal unit, or BTU, may be more widely used in North America than in
Britain. Air conditioners, furnaces, and stoves are generally rated by BTUs. (Though “BTUs” is often
short for “BTUs per hour”; in air-conditioner ratings, for instance, “BTUs” really means “BTUs of
cooling capacity per hour.”) Fuels such as natural gas and propane are also compared using BTUs.
The BTU first appeared in 1876 and isn't part of the metric system—the metric unit of energy is the
much  smaller  joule—so  it  isn't  much  used  by  scientists,  but  its  practicality  keeps  it  popular  for
consumer  goods  and  fuels.  A  better-known  heat  unit  is  the  calorie;  a  BTU  is  equal  to  about  252
calories. (Since the familiar food calorie is actually a kilocalorie, a BTU equals only about a quarter
of a food calorie.)
