- POLY  comes  from  polys,  the  Greek  word  for  “many.”  A  polytechnic  institute  offers  instruction  in
many technical fields. Polygamy is marriage in which one has many spouses, or at least more than the
legal limit of one. And polysyllabic words are words of many syllables—of which there are quite a
few in this book.

- [[polyp]] 
tentacles. (2) A growth projecting from a mucous membrane, as on the colon or vocal cords. 

  (1)  A  sea  invertebrate  that  has  a  mouth  opening  at  one  end  surrounded  by  stinging

• She had had a polyp removed from her throat, and for two weeks afterward she could only whisper. 

This term comes from polypous, a Greek word for “octopus,” which meant literally “many-footed.”
To  the  untrained  eye,  the  invertebrate  known  as  the  polyp  may  likewise  appear  to  be  many-footed,
though it never walks anywhere since its “feet” are tentacles, used for stinging tiny organisms which
the polyp then devours. The types of tumor known as polyps got their name because some seem to be
attached to the surface by branching “foot”-like roots, even though most do not. Polyps of the nose or
vocal  cords  are  usually  only  inconvenient,  causing  breathing  difficulty  or  hoarseness,  and  can  be
removed easily; however, polyps in the intestines can sometimes turn cancerous.

- [[polyglot]] 
several languages. 

  (1)  One  who  can  speak  or  write  several  languages.  (2)  Having  or  using

• As trade between countries increases, there is more need for polyglots who can act as negotiators. 

Polyglot contains the root glot,  meaning  “language.”  It  is  used  both  as  a  noun  and  as  an  adjective.
Thus, we could say that an international airport is bound to be polyglot, with people from all over the
world  speaking  their  native  languages.  One  of  history's  more  interesting  polyglots  was  the  Holy
Roman Emperor Charles V, who claimed that he addressed his horse only in German, conversed with
women in Italian and with men in French, but reserved Spanish (his original language) for his talks
with God.

- [[polymer]] 
combine to form larger molecules with repeating structural units. 

 A chemical compound formed by a reaction in which two or more molecules

• Nylon, a polymer commercially introduced in 1938, can be spun and woven into fabrics or cast as
tough, elastic blocks. 

There  are  many  natural  polymers,  including  shellac,  cellulose,  and  rubber.  But  synthetic  polymers
only came into being around 1870 with Celluloid, known especially for its use in photographic film.
After many decades of development, the polymeric compounds now include polypropylene, used in
milk crates, luggage, and hinges; polyurethane, used in paints, adhesives, molded items, rubbers, and
foams;  and  polyvinyl  chloride  (PVC),  used  to  make  pipes  that  won't  rust.  And  let's  not  forget
polyester, which gave us a lot of uncool clothing in the 1970s but whose strength and resistance to
corrosion have ensured that it remains an extremely useful material for all kinds of goods.

blood pressure and rate of breathing) at the same time; lie detector. 

  An  instrument  for  recording  changes  in  several  bodily  functions  (such  as

•  My  brother-in-law  is  completely  law-abiding,  but  he's  such  a  nervous  type  that  he's  failed  two
polygraph tests at job interviews. 

With its graph- [[root]] (see GRAPH), polygraph indicates that it writes out several different results. A
polygraph's  output  consists  of  a  set  of  squiggly  lines  on  a  computer  screen,  each  indicating  one
function  being  tested.  The  functions  most  commonly  measured  are  blood  pressure,  breathing  rate,
pulse, and perspiration, all of which tend to increase when you lie. Polygraphs have been in use since
1924,  and  have  gotten  more  sensitive  over  the  years,  though  many  experts  still  believe  that  they're
unreliable and that a prepared liar can fool the machine. They're used not only for law enforcement
but  perhaps  more  often  by  employers—often  the  police  department  itself!—who  don't  want  to  hire
someone who has broken the law in the past but won't admit to it.

- PRIM  comes  from  primus,  the  Latin  word  for  “first.”  Something  primary  is  first  in  time,  rank,  or
