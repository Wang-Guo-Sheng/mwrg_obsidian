- PEND  comes  from  the  Latin  verb  pendere,  meaning  “to  hang”  or  “to  weigh.”  (In  the  Roman  era,
weighing something large often required hanging it from a hook on one side of the balance scales.) We
find  the  root  in  English  words  like  appendix,  referring  to  that  useless  and  sometimes  troublesome
tube that hangs from the intestine, or that section at the back of some books that might contain some
useful additional information.

- [[pendant]] 

 Something that hangs down, especially as an ornament. 

• Around her neck she was wearing the antique French pendant he had given her, with its three rubies
set in silver filigree. 

Most  pendants  are  purely  decorative.  But  a  pendant  may  also  hold  a  picture  or  a  lock  of  hair  of  a
lover or a child. And, perhaps because they hang protectively in front of the body and near the heart,
pendants have often had symbolic and magical purposes. Thus, a pendant may be a charm or amulet,
or  its  gems  or  metals  may  be  felt  to  have  health-giving  properties.  In  architecture,  a  pendant  is  an
ornament  that  hangs  down  from  a  structure,  but  unlike  a  necklace  pendant  it's  usually  solid  and
inflexible.

- [[append]] 

 To add as something extra. 

• She appended to the memo a list of the specific items that the school was most in need of. 

Append is a somewhat formal word. Lawyers, for example, often speak of appending items to other
documents,  and  lawmakers  frequently  append  small  bills  to  big  ones,  hoping  that  everyone  will  be
paying  attention  only  to  the  main  part  of  the  big  bill  and  won't  notice.  When  we  append  a  small
separate section to the end of a report or a book, we call it an appendix. But in the early years of e-
mail,  the  words  we  decided  on  were  attach  and  attachment,  probably  because  appendixes  are
thought of as unimportant, whereas the attachment is often the whole reason for sending an e-mail.

- [[appendage]] 
secondary body part, such as an arm or a leg. 

 (1) Something joined on to a larger or more important body or thing. (2) A

• She often complained that she felt like a mere appendage of her husband when they socialized with
his business partners. 

Appendix isn't the only noun that comes from append. Unlike appendix, appendage  doesn't  suggest
the  end  of  something,  but  simply  something  attached.  The  word  is  often  used  in  biology  to  refer  to
parts of an animal's body: an insect's antennae, mouthparts, or wings, for example. The appendages of
some animals will grow back after they've been removed; a salamander, for example, can regrow a
finger, and the tiny sea squirt can regrow all its appendages—and even its brain.

- [[suspend]] 
for a limited time. (2) To hang something so that it is free on all sides. 

 (1) To stop something, or to force someone to give up some right or position,

• The country has been suspended from the major trade organizations, and the effects on its economy
are beginning to be felt. 

When  something  is  suspended,  it  is  “left  hanging”;  it  is  neither  in  full  operation  nor  permanently
ended. Suspense  is  a  state  of  uncertainty  and  maybe  anxiety.  When  we  watch  a  play  or  movie,  we
enjoy experiencing a “suspension of disbelief”; that is, we allow ourselves to believe we're watching
reality,  even  though  we  aren't  truly  fooled.Suspension  can  also  mean  physical  hanging;  thus,  in  a
suspension  bridge,  the  roadway  actually  hangs  from  huge  cables.  When  some  substance  is  “in
suspension,” its particles are “hanging” in another substance, mixed into it but not actually dissolved,
like fine sand in water, or sea spray in the air at the seashore.
