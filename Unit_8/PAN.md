- PAN comes from a Greek word meaning “all”; as an English prefix, it can also mean “completely,”
“whole,” or “general.” A panoramic view is a complete view in every direction. A pantheon is a
temple dedicated to all the gods of a religion. A pandemic outbreak of a disease may not affect the
entire human population, but enough to produce a catastrophe.

- [[panacea]] 

 A remedy for all ills or difficulties; cure-all. 

• Educational reform is sometimes viewed as the panacea for all of society's problems. 

Panacea comes from a Greek word meaning “all-healing,” and Panacea was the goddess of healing.
In the Middle Ages and the Renaissance, alchemists who sought to concoct the “elixir of life” (which
would give eternal life) and the “philosopher's stone” (which would turn ordinary metals into gold)
also labored to find the panacea. But no such medicine was ever found, just as no solution to all of a
society's difficulties has ever been found. Thus, panacea is almost always used to criticize the very
idea of a total solution (“There's no panacea for the current problems plaguing Wall Street”).

- [[pandemonium]] 

 A wild uproar or commotion. 

• Pandemonium erupted in the stadium as the ball shot past the goalie into the net. 

In  John  Milton's  Paradise  Lost,  the  fallen  Satan  has  his  heralds  proclaim  “A  solemn  Councel
forthwith to be held / At Pandaemonium, the high Capital / Of Satan and his Peers.” Milton got the
name for his capital of hell, where Satan gathered together all his demons, by linking pan with the
Latin  word  daemonium,  “evil  spirit.”  For  later  writers,  pandemonium  became  a  synonym  for  hell
itself,  since  hell  was  then  often  seen  as  a  place  of  constant  noise  and  confusion,  but  also  for  any
wicked and lawless place. Nowadays it's used to refer to the uproar itself rather than the place where
it occurs.

- [[pantheism]] 
laws of the universe. 

 A system of belief that regards God as identical with the forces and

• Most of her students seemed to accept a vague kind of pantheism, without any real belief that God
had ever appeared in human form. 

Pantheistic  ideas—and  most  importantly  the  belief  that  God  is  equal  to  the  universe,  its  physical
matter,  and  the  forces  that  govern  it—are  found  in  the  ancient  books  of  Hinduism,  in  the  works  of
many  Greek  philosophers,  and  in  later  works  of  philosophy  and  religion  over  the  centuries.  Much
modern New Age spirituality is pantheistic. But most Christian thinkers reject pantheism because it
makes God too impersonal, doesn't allow for any difference between the creation and the creator, and
doesn't seem to allow for humans to make meaningful moral choices.

- [[panoply]] 
accessory items. 

  (1)  A  magnificent  or  impressive  array.  (2)  A  display  of  all  appropriate

• The full panoply of a royal coronation was a thrilling sight for the throngs of sidewalk onlookers
and the millions of television viewers. 

The fully armed Greek soldier was an impressive sight, even if Greek armor never became as heavy
as  that  of  medieval  knights  on  horseback  (who  couldn't  possibly  have  marched  in  such  outfits).
Panoplia was the Greek word for the full suit of armor, and the English panoply originally likewise
referred  to  the  full  suit  of  armor  worn  by  a  soldier  or  knight.  Today  panoply  may  refer  to  full
ceremonial  dress  or  lavish  ceremonial  decoration  of  any  kind.  And  it  can  also  refer  to  striking
spectacle of almost any kind: the breathtaking panoply of autumn foliage, or the stirring panoply of a
military parade, for example.

- EXTRA is Latin for “outside” or “beyond.” So anything extraterrestrial or extragalactic takes place
