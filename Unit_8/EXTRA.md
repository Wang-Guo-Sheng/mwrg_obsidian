- EXTRA is Latin for “outside” or “beyond.” So anything extraterrestrial or extragalactic takes place
beyond the earth or the galaxy. Something extravagant, such as an extravaganza, goes way beyond
the normal. And extra is naturally a word itself, a shortening of extraordinary, “beyond the ordinary.”

will be held. 

  To  deliver  an  accused  criminal  from  one  place  to  another  where  the  trial

• Picked up by the Colorado police for burglary, he's being extradited to Mississippi to face trial for
murder. 

Extradition  from  one  state  to  another  is  generally  a  straightforward  process.  But  extradition  may
become more complicated when two countries are involved, even though most countries have signed
treaties  stating  that  they  will  send  criminals  to  the  country  where  they  are  wanted.  Many  countries
often won't send their own citizens to another country for trial; countries that don't permit the death
penalty  may  not  agree  to  send  a  suspect  back  to  face  such  a  penalty;  and  most  countries  won't
extradite  someone  accused  of  political  crimes.  When  extradition  seems  unlikely,  a  country  may
actually kidnap someone from another country, but this is illegal and rare.

- [[extrapolate]]

 To extend or project facts or data into an area not known in order to

• Economists predict future buying trends partly by extrapolating from current economic data. 

Scientists  worry  about  the  greenhouse  effect  because  they  have  extrapolated  the  rate  of  carbon-
dioxide buildup and predicted that its effect on the atmosphere will become increasingly severe. On
the  basis  of  their  extrapolations,  they  have  urged  governments  and  businesses  to  limit  factory  and
automobile emissions. Notice that it's acceptable to speak of extrapolating existing data (to produce
new data), extrapolating from existing data (to produce new data), or extrapolating new data (from
existing data)—in other words, it isn't easy to use this word wrong.

- [[extrovert]] 
and outgoing person. 

 A person mainly concerned with things outside him- [[or]] herself; a sociable

• These parties are always full of loud extroverts, and I always find myself hiding in a corner with my
drink. 

Extrovert  (sometimes  spelled  extravert)  means  basically  “turned  outward”—that  is,  toward  things
outside  oneself.  The  word  was  coined  by  the  eminent  psychologist  C.  G.  Jung  in  the  early  20th
century.  The  opposite  personality  type,  in  Jung's  view,  was  the  introvert.  Extroverts  seem  to  be
favored by societies such as ours, even though introverts seem to be on average more mentally gifted.
Psychologists have said that the only personality traits that can be identified in newborn infants are
shyness and lack of shyness, which are fairly close to—but not really the same as—introversion and
extroversion.

• Be sure your essays are well focused, with any discussion of extraneous topics kept to a minimum. 

Extraneous  and  strange  both  come  from  the  same  Latin  word,  extraneus,  which  basically  meant
“external” or “coming from outside.” But unlike strange, extraneous is a slightly formal word, often
used  by  scientists  and  social  scientists.  Researchers  always  try  to  eliminate  extraneous  factors  (or
“extraneous variables”) from their studies. A researcher conducting a psychological test, for example,
would  try  to  make  sure  that  the  people  were  tested  under  the  same  conditions,  and  were  properly
divided according to gender, age, health, and so on.
