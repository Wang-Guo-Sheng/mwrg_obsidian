PORT  comes  from  the  Latin  verb  portare,  meaning  “to  carry.”  Thus,  something  portable  can  be
carried  around.  A  porter  carries  your  luggage,  whether  through  a  train  station  or  high  into  the
Himalayas. When we transport something, we have it carried from one place to another. And goods
for export are carried away to another country.

- [[portage]] 
regular route for such carrying. 

 The carrying of boats or goods overland from one body of water to another; also, a

•  The  only  portage  on  the  whole  canoe  route  would  be  the  one  around  the  great  waterfall  on  our
second day. 

Portage  was  borrowed  from  French  back  in  the  15th  century  to  mean  “carrying,  transporting”  or
“freight,” and it has kept its simple “carrying” sense to the present day. But its first known use in its
“carrying of boats” sense came in 1698, and the obstacle that the canoes couldn't be steered over was
none  other  than  Niagara  Falls.  Though  canoes  are  much  lighter  today  than  they  used  to  be,  a  long
portage that includes a lot of camping gear can still test a camper's strength.

- [[portfolio]] 
owned by a person or organization. 

  (1)  A  flat  case  for  carrying  documents  or  artworks.  (2)  The  investments

• In those days, a graphic artist who had recently moved to New York would just schlep his portfolio
around to every magazine office in the city. 

Portfolio is partly based on the Latin folium, meaning “leaf, sheet.” A portfolio usually represents a
portable  showcase  of  your  talents.  Today  actual  portfolios  are  used  less  than  they  used  to  be  by
artists, since most commercial artists have a Web site dedicated to showing off their art. But portfolio
in its other common meaning is extremely common. Not so long ago, a broker would keep each of his
or her clients' investments in a separate notebook or portfolio. Today the investment portfolio, like an
artist's portfolio, usually takes the form of a Web page, even though everyone still uses the same old
word.

- [[comport]] 

 (1) To be in agreement with. (2) To behave. 

• This new evidence comports with everything we know about what happened that night. 

With its prefix com-, “with,” the Latin word comportare meant “to bring together.” So it's easy to see
how in English we could say that a college's policy comports with state law, or that a visit to your
parents  doesn't  comport  with  your  other  weekend  plans,  or  that  your  aunt  and  uncle  won't  listen  to
anything  on  TV  that  doesn't  comport  with  their  prejudices.  The  “behave”  sense  of  the  word  comes
through French, and its essential meaning is how a person “carries” him- [[or]] herself. So you may say,
for instance, that your 17-year-old comported himself well (for once!) at the wedding reception, or
that  an  ambassador  always  comports  herself  with  dignity—that  is,  her  comportment  is  always
dignified—or that your class comported itself in a way that was a credit to the school.

- [[deportment]] 

 Manner of conducting oneself socially. 

• At social events she would constantly sneak glances at Alexandra, in quiet admiration of her elegant
and graceful deportment. 

We've all seen pictures of girls walking around balancing books on their heads in an effort to achieve
the  poise  of  a  princess  or  a  film  star.  Classes  in  deportment  were  once  a  standard  part  of  a  young
lady's upbringing, offered in all the girls' colleges; and you can still take private deportment classes,
where  you'll  learn  about  posture  and  body  language,  how  to  move,  sit,  stand,  shake  hands,  dress,
drink and eat, and much more. But deportment isn't all about refined female grace. In fact, deport is
often  used  as  a  synonym  for  comport,  but  usually  in  a  positive  way;  thus,  people  are  often  said  to
deport themselves well, confidently, with dignity, like gentlemen or ladies, and so on.

- PEND  comes  from  the  Latin  verb  pendere,  meaning  “to  hang”  or  “to  weigh.”  (In  the  Roman  era,
