- LUC  comes  from  the  Latin  noun  lux,  “light,”  and  the  verb  lucere,  “to  shine  or  glitter.”  In  ancient
Rome, Lucifer,  meaning  “Light-bearer,”  was  the  name  given  to  the  morning  star,  but  the  name  was
eventually  transferred  by  Christians  to  Satan.  This  tradition,  which  dates  back  to  the  period  before
Christ, said that Lucifer had once been among the angels but had wanted to be the great light in the
sky, and for his pride had been cast out of heaven and thus became the opponent of everything good.

- [[lucid]] 

 (1) Very clear and easy to understand. (2) Able to think clearly. 

• On his last visit he had noticed that his elderly mother hadn't seemed completely lucid. 

Mental  lucidity  is  easy  to  take  for  granted  when  we're  young,  though  alcohol,  drugs,  and
psychological instability can confuse the mind at any age. We all hope to live to 100 with our mental
abilities intact, which is entirely possible; avoiding the condition called dementia (which includes the
well-known Alzheimer's disease) often involves a combination of decent genes, physical and mental
activity, and a good diet. Writing lucidly, on the other hand, can take a lot of work at any age; you've
probably had the experience of trying to read a set of instructions and wondering if the writer even
grew up speaking English.

- [[elucidate]] 

 To clarify by explaining; explain. 

• A good doctor should always be willing to elucidate any medical jargon he or she uses. 

The basic meaning of elucidate is “to shed light on.” So when you elucidate, you make transparent or
clear something that had been murky or confusing. Elucidation of a complex new health-care policy
may be a challenge. Elucidation of the terms of use for a credit card may be the last thing its provider
wants  to  do.  The  physicist  Carl  Sagan  had  a  gift  for  elucidating  astronomical  science  to  a  large
audience, his lucid explanations making clear how stars are born and die and how the universe may
have begun.

- [[lucubration]] 

 (1) Hard and difficult study. (2) The product of such study. 

•  Our  professor  admitted  that  he  wasn't  looking  forward  to  reading  through  any  more  of  our
lucubrations on novels that no one enjoyed. 

Lucubration came to mean “hard study” because it originally meant study done by lamplight, and in a
world  without  electric  lights,  such  study  was  likely  to  be  the  kind  of  hard  work  that  would  only  a
dedicated student like Abe Lincoln would make a habit of. The word has a literary feel to it, and it's
often used with a touch of sarcasm.

- [[translucent]] 
objects beyond to be seen clearly. 

  Partly  transparent;  allowing  light  to  pass  through  without  permitting

• Architects today often use industrial glass bricks in their home designs, because translucent walls
admit daylight while guarding privacy. 

With  its  prefix  trans-,  meaning  “through,”  translucent  describes  material  that  light  shines  through
without  making  anything  on  the  other  side  clearly  visible,  unlike  a  transparent  material.  Frosted
glass,  often  used  in  bathroom  windows,  is  translucent,  as  is  stained  glass.  Red  wine  in  a  crystal
goblet,  when  held  before  a  candle  in  a  dark  corner  of  a  quiet  restaurant,  usually  proves  to  be
translucent as well.
