- PHOT comes from the Greek word for “light.” Photography uses light to create an image on film or
paper, and a photocopy is an image made by using light and tiny electrically charged ink particles.

- [[photoelectric]] 
radiation. 

 Involving an electrical effect produced by the action of light or other

• They wanted to avoid the kind of smoke detector that uses radioactive materials, so they've installed
the photoelectric kind instead. 

The photoelectric effect occurs when light (or similar radiation such as X-rays) falls on a material
such as a metal plate and causes it to emit electrons. The discovery of the photoelectric effect led to
important new theories about matter (and to a Nobel Prize for Albert Einstein). Photoelectric cells,
or  photocells,  are  used  in  burglar-alarm  light  detectors  and  garage-door  openers  (both  employ  a
beam of light that is broken when something moves across it), and also to play soundtracks on movie
film  (where  a  light  beam  shines  through  the  soundtrack  encoded  on  the  film  and  is  “read”  by  the
photocells).

- [[photovoltaic]] 
 Involving the direct generation of electricity when sunlight or other
radiant  energy  falls  on  the  boundary  between  dissimilar  substances  (such  as  two  different
semiconductors). 

• Photovoltaic technology is being applied to thin film that can produce as much energy as solar cells
while using far less semiconducting material. 

The -voltaic part of photovoltaic comes from the name of Alessandro Volta, inventor of the electric
battery. Thus, unlike photoelectric cells, which use electricity for certain small tasks, photovoltaic (or
PV)  cells  actually  produce  electricity.  Solar  cells,  the  standard  type  of  photovoltaic  cells  (often
called  simply  photocells),  operate  without  chemicals  and  with  no  moving  parts  to  create  energy
directly from sunlight. Much research is now being done on creating an alternative technology—solar
film, which could be stuck onto almost any surface, or possibly even sprayed on.

- [[photon]] 

 A tiny particle or bundle of radiant energy. 

• The idea that light consists of photons is difficult until you begin to think of a ray of light as being
caused by a stream of tiny particles. 

It  was  Albert  Einstein  who  first  theorized  that  the  energy  in  a  light  beam  exists  in  small  bits  or
particles, and scientists today know that light sometimes behaves like a wave (somewhat like sound
or water) and sometimes like a stream of particles. The energies of photons range from high-energy
gamma rays and X-rays down to low-energy infrared and radio waves, though all travel at the same
speed. The amazing power of lasers is the result of a concentration of photons that have been made to
travel together in order to hit their target at the same time.

- [[photosynthesis]] 
matter from carbon dioxide and water. 

 The process by which green plants use light to produce organic

• Sagebrush survives in harsh climates because it's capable of carrying on photosynthesis at very low
temperatures. 

The Greek roots of photosynthesis combine to produce the basic meaning “to put together with the
help of light.” Photosynthesis is what first produced oxygen in the atmosphere billions of years ago,
and it's still what keeps it there. Sunlight splits the water molecules (made of hydrogen and oxygen)
held in a plant's leaves and releases the oxygen in them into the air. The leftover hydrogen combines
with carbon dioxide to produce carbohydrates, which the plant uses as food—as do any animals or
humans who might eat the plant.

- LUC  comes  from  the  Latin  noun  lux,  “light,”  and  the  verb  lucere,  “to  shine  or  glitter.”  In  ancient
