- MOR/MORT comes from Latin words meaning “to die” and “death.” A mortuary is a place where
dead bodies are kept until burial, and a postmortem examination is one conducted on a recently dead
body. The Latin phrase “Memento mori” means “Remember that you must die”; so a memento mori is
the  name  we  give  to  a  reminder  of  death;  the  skulls  you  can  find  carved  on  gravestones  in  old
cemeteries are examples.

- [[mortality]] 
number of deaths that occur in a particular time or place. 

 (1) The quality or state of being alive and therefore certain to die. (2) The

• Mortality rates were highest among those who those who lived closest to the plant. 

Young people tend to assume they will never die; but a person's sense of his or her mortality generally
increases  year  by  year,  and  often  increases  greatly  after  a  serious  accident  or  illness.  Still,  many
people refuse to change behaviors that would improve their chances of living into old age. Mortality
rates  are  calculated  by  government  agencies,  insurance  companies,  and  medical  researchers.  Infant
mortality  rates  (the  rate  at  which  infants  die  in  childbirth)  provide  a  good  indicator  of  a  country's
overall  health;  in  recent  years,  the  rates  in  countries  like  Iceland,  Singapore,  and  Japan  have  been
much better than in the U.S.

- [[moribund]] 
outmoded. 

 (1) In the process of dying or approaching death. (2) Inactive or becoming

• Church attendance in Britain has fallen in recent years, but no one would say the Anglican church is
moribund. 

Moribund is still sometimes used in its original literal sense of “approaching death,” but it's much
more often used to describe things. When the economy goes bad, we hear about moribund mills and
factories  and  towns;  the  economy  itself  may  even  be  called  moribund.  Critics  may  speak  of  the
moribund state of poetry, or lament the moribund record or newspaper industry.

- [[amortize]] 
period of time. 

 To pay off (something such as a mortgage) by making small payments over a

•  For  tax  purposes,  they  chose  to  amortize  most  of  the  business's  start-up  costs  over  a  three-year
period. 

Amortize is most common as a legal term, and many of us first come across it when we take out a
mortgage or start a business. Financial officers and tax lawyers can choose how to legally amortize
various  types  of  business  expenses,  some  of  which  may  seem  much  better  than  others.  In  mortgage
amortization,  much  of  what  you  pay  month  by  month  is  actually  interest  on  the  mortgage  debt,
especially at the beginning. So what does amortizing have to do with death? Basically, to amortize a
debt means to “kill” it slowly over time.

- [[mortify]] 
inflicted pain. (2) To embarrass greatly. 

  (1)  To  subdue  or  deaden  (the  body)  especially  by  self-discipline  or  self-

• Our 14-year-old is mortified whenever he sees us dancing, especially if any of his school friends
are around. 

Mortify once actually meant “put to death,” but no longer. Its “deaden” sense is most familiar to us in
the phrase “mortifying the flesh,” which refers to a custom once followed by devout Christians, who
would starve themselves, deprive themselves of every comfort, and even whip themselves in order to
subdue their bodily desires and punish themselves for their sins. But the most common use of mortify
today is the “humiliate” sense; its connection with death is still apparent when we speak of “dying of
embarrassment.”
