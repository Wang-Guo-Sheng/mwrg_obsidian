- TROPH comes from the Greek trophe,  meaning  “nourishment.”  This  particular  troph-  root  doesn't
show  up  in  many  everyday  English  words  (the  troph-  in  words  like  trophy,  apostrophe,  and
catastrophe has a different meaning), but instead tends to appear in scientific terms.

- [[atrophy]] 
A decline or degeneration. 

 (1) Gradual loss of muscle or flesh, usually because of disease or lack of use. (2)

•  After  a  month  in  a  hospital  bed,  my  father  required  a  round  of  physical  therapy  to  deal  with  his
muscular atrophy. 

From  its  literal  Greek  roots,  atrophy  would  mean  basically  “lack  of  nourishment.”  Although  the
English word doesn't usually imply any lack of food, it always refers to a wasting away. Those who
have been bedridden for a period of time will notice that their muscles have atrophied. And muscular
atrophy is a frequent result of such diseases as cancer and AIDS. We also use atrophy in a much more
general sense. After being out of work a few years, you may find your work skills have atrophied;
someone who's been living an isolated life may discover the same thing about his or her social skills;
and a democracy can atrophy when its citizens cease to pay attention to how they're being governed.

- [[hypertrophy]] 
or complexity. 

 (1) Excessive development of an organ or part. (2) Exaggerated growth

• Opponents claimed that the Defense Department, after years of being given too much money by the
Congress, was now suffering from hypertrophy. 

When the prefix hyper-, “above, beyond” (see HYPER), is joined to -trophy, we get the opposite of
atrophy.  An  organ  or  part  becomes  hypertrophic  when  it  grows  so  extremely  that  its  function  is
affected. Muscle hypertrophy is common in men who do strength training, and is often harmless; but
extreme  muscle  hypertrophy  generally  involves  taking  steroids,  which  can  do  great  damage  to  the
body. Hypertrophy of the heart sounds as if it might be healthy, but instead it's usually a bad sign. As
the example sentence shows, hypertrophy, like atrophy, can be used in nonmedical ways as well.

- [[dystrophy]] 
muscular dystrophy. 

  Any  of  several  disorders  involving  the  nerves  and  muscles,  especially

• The most common of the muscular dystrophies affects only males, who rarely live to the age of 40. 

Since  the  prefix  dys-  means  “bad”  or  “difficult”  (see  DYS), dystrophy  is  always  a  negative  term.
Originally it meant “a condition caused by improper nutrition,” but today the term is instead used for
a variety of other conditions, particularly conditions that noticeably affect the muscles. Of the many
types of muscular dystrophy, the best known is Duchenne's, a terrible disease that strikes about one in
3,300  males  and  produces  severe  wasting  of  the  muscles.  However,  the  muscular  dystrophies
generally  affect  many  other  organs  and  systems  as  well.  And  the  other  dystrophies,  which  tend  to
involve the eyes or hands, don't much resemble the muscular dystrophies.

- [[eutrophication]] 
dissolved nutrients. 

 The process by which a body of water becomes enriched in

• Local naturalists are getting worried about the increasing eutrophication they've been noticing in the
lake. 

Eutrophication, which comes from the Greek eutrophos, “well-nourished” (see EU), has become a
major environmental problem. Nitrates and phosphates, especially from lawn fertilizers, run off the
land into rivers and lakes, promoting the growth of algae and other plant life, which take oxygen from
the water, causing the death of fish and mollusks. Cow manure, agricultural fertilizer, detergents, and
human  waste  are  often  to  blame  as  well.  In  the  1960s  and  '70s,  the  eutrophication  of  Lake  Erie
advanced  so  extremely  that  it  became  known  as  the  “dead  lake.”  And  many  areas  of  the  oceans
worldwide—some  more  than  20,000  square  miles  in  extent—have  become  “dead  zones,”  where
almost no life of any kind exists.

- Words from Mythology and History

aeolian harp 
when the wind blows on them. 

 A box-shaped instrument with strings that produce musical sounds

• Poets have long been fascinated by the aeolian harp, the only instrument that produces music without
a human performer. 

According to the ancient Greeks, Aeolus was the king or guardian of the winds. He lived in a cave
with  his  many,  many  sons  and  daughters,  and  sent  forth  whatever  wind  Zeus  asked  for.  When
Odysseus stopped there on his way home from Troy, he received a bag of winds to fill his sails. But
while he was asleep, his men, thinking it contained treasure, opened the bag and released the raging
winds,  which  blew  their  ships  all  the  way  back  to  their  starting  point.  An  aeolian  harp  produces
enchanting harmonies when the wind passes over it. According to Homer, it was the god Hermes who
invented  the  harp,  by  having  the  wind  blow  over  the  dried  sinews  attached  to  the  shell  of  a  dead
tortoise.

- [[cynosure]] 

 (1) A guide. (2) A center of attention. 

• Near the club's dance floor, a young rock star was hanging out, the cynosure of a small crowd of
admirers. 

In Greek kynosoura means “dog's tail,” and in Latin Cynosura came to mean the constellation Ursa
Minor  (Little  Bear)—what  we  usually  call  the  Little  Dipper.  The  first  star  on  the  dog's  or  bear's
“tail,”  or  the  dipper's  “handle,”  is  Polaris,  the  North  Star,  long  used  as  a  guide  for  seamen  or
travelers lost on a clear night, since, unlike the other stars, it always remains in the same position in
the  northern  sky,  while  the  other  constellations  (and  even  the  rest  of  its  own  constellation)  slowly
revolve around it. Since Cynosura also came to mean the star itself, the English cynosure now may
mean both “guide” and “center of attention.”

- [[laconic]] 

 Using extremely few words. 

• Action-film scripts usually seem to call for laconic leading men who avoid conversation but get the
job done. 

Ancient Sparta was located in the region of Greece known as Laconia, and the Greek word lakonikos
could  mean  both  “Laconian”  and  “Spartan.”  The  disciplined  and  militaristic  Spartans,  the  finest
warriors  of  their  time,  were  known  for  putting  up  with  extreme  conditions  without  complaint.  So
English writers who knew their ancient history came to use laconic to describe the habit of saying
few words. Today we can refer not only to a laconic person but also to laconic wit, a laconic answer,
or a laconic phrase—such as “Men of few words require few laws,” uttered by a Spartan king.

- [[mnemonic]] 

 Having to do with the memory; assisting the memory. 

•  Sales-training  courses  recommend  various  mnemonic  devices  as  a  way  of  remembering  peoples'
names. 

The  Greek  word  for  memory  is  mnemosyne,  and  Mnemosyne  was  the  goddess  of  memory  and  the
mother of the Muses. So something that helps the memory is a mnemonic aid, or simply a mnemonic.
Such traditional mnemonic devices as “Every Good Boy Does Fine” (for the notes on the lines of a
musical staff with a treble clef) or the “Thirty days hath September” rhyme help to recall simple rules
or complicated series that might otherwise slip away. (For extra credit, guess what “King Henry Died
Drinking Chocolate Milk” or “King Philip Could Only Find Green Socks” stands for.) Notice that the
first m isn't pronounced, unlike in other -mne- [[words]] such as amnesia and amnesty.

- [[platonic]] 
relationship from which romance and sex are absent. 

  (1)  Relating  to  the  philosopher  Plato  or  his  teachings.  (2)  Involving  a  close

• The male and female leads in sitcoms often keep their relationship platonic for the first few seasons,
but romance almost always wins out in the end. 

The philosopher Plato presented his theories in a series of dramatic conversations between Socrates
and  other  people,  now  called  the  “Platonic  dialogues.”  Among  many  other  important  concepts,  he
taught  that  everything  here  on  earth  is  a  pale  imitation—like  a  shadow—of  its  ideal  form,  and  this
ideal  form  is  now  often  called  the  “platonic  form.”  But  platonic  is  probably  usually  seen  in  the
phrase “platonic love.” Because Socrates (through Plato) teaches that the philosophical person should
turn  his  passion  for  a  lover  into  appreciation  of  beauty  and  love  of  a  higher  power  and  of  the
universe, close but nonsexual friendship between two people who might be thought to be romantically
attracted is today known as platonic love or friendship.

- [[sapphic]] 

 (1) Lesbian. (2) Relating to a poetic verse pattern associated with Sappho. 

• The Roman poets Catullus and Horace composed wonderful love poems in sapphic verse. 

The poet Sappho wrote poems of self-reflection but also of passion, some of it directed to the women
attending the school she conducted on the Greek island of Lesbos around 600 B.C. Even though most
of  the  poems  survive  only  as  fragments,  they  have  been  greatly  admired  for  many  centuries.  They
were  written  in  an  original  rhythmical  pattern,  which  has  become  known  as  sapphic  verse.  Later
admirers, such as the Roman poets Catullus and Horace, honored her by adopting the sapphic meter
for  their  own  poetry.  Because  of  Sappho,  the  island  of  Lesbos  also  gave  its  name  to  lesbianism,
which writers often used to call sapphic love.

- Socratic 
which he systematically questioned the student in conversation in order to draw forth truths. 

  Having  to  do  with  the  philosopher  Socrates  or  with  his  teaching  method,  in

•  She  challenges  her  students  by  using  the  Socratic  method,  requiring  them  to  think  and  respond
constantly in every class. 

Socrates  lived  and  taught  in  Athens  in  the  5th  century  B.C.,  but  left  no  writings  behind,  so  all  we
know of him comes through the works of his disciple Plato, almost all of which claim to be accounts
of Socrates' conversations with others. Today Socrates is best remembered for his method of teaching
by asking increasingly difficult questions, the so-called Socratic method. This generally involves the
use  of  Socratic  induction,  a  way  of  gradually  arriving  at  generalizations  through  a  process  of
questions and answers, and Socratic irony, in which the teacher pretends ignorance while questioning
his students skillfully to make them aware of their errors in understanding.

- [[solecism]] 
etiquette or proper behavior. 

  (1)  A  grammatical  mistake  in  speaking  or  writing.  (2)  A  blunder  in

• The poor boy committed his first solecism immediately on entering by tracking mud over the Persian
rug in the dining room. 

In ancient Asia Minor (now Turkey), there was a city called Soloi where the inhabitants spoke Greek
that was full of grammatical errors. So errors in grammar, and later also small errors in formal social
behavior,  came  to  be  known  (at  least  by  intellectuals)  as  solecisms.  The  British  magazine  The
Economist  publishes  a  list  of  solecisms  to  be  avoided  in  its  prose,  including  the  use  of  “try  and”
when you mean “try to,” “hone in on” when you mean “home in on,” and so forth. Social solecisms,
such as mentioning how inferior the wine is to someone who turns out to be the hostess's sister, are
more commonly called by a French name, faux pas.
