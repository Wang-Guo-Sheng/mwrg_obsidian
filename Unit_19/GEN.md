- GEN, which comes from the Greek genos, meaning “birth,” has generated dozens of English words.
A set of genes, for instance, gives birth to a living being. And a genealogy is a historical map of your
family, showing how each generation gave birth to the next.

- [[genesis]] 

 Origin, beginning. 

• The genesis of the project dates back to 1976, when the two young men were roommates at Cornell
University. 

The  traditional  Greek  name  for  the  first  and  best-known  book  of  the  Bible  is  Genesis,  meaning
“origin.”  Genesis  tells  the  stories  of  the  creation,  Adam  and  Eve,  Cain  and  Abel,  Noah's  ark,  the
Tower  of  Babel,  Abraham  and  his  sons,  and  more—the  stories  that  explain  how  the  world  and
humanity  were  created,  as  well  as  much  about  how  humanity,  and  especially  the  descendants  of
Abraham, relate to the rest of the world. Today we use genesis to refer to the creative beginnings of
much smaller things, but never unimportant ones.

- [[generator]] 

 A machine by which mechanical energy is changed into electrical energy 

•  The  jungle  settlement  depended  on  a  large  generator,  which  provided  electricity  for  a  couple  of
hours each morning and evening. 

Generators work by rotating a coil of wire in a magnetic field, causing a current to flow in the wire.
A generator may be a huge spinning turbine powered by water, wind, steam, gas, or nuclear reactions,
which sends electricity out through power lines to thousands of customers. But normally when we use
the word, we're thinking of a small machine powered by gasoline or diesel, such as you might keep in
your basement for those times when a storm knocks out your power, to create electricity right in front
of  your  eyes.  A  special  kind  of  generator  called  an  alternator  powers  a  car's  electrical  system
(including its lights, power steering, etc.) while the car is running.

- [[genre]] 

 Kind, sort; especially a distinctive type or category of literature, art, or music. 

• Opera was a new genre for her, since all her compositions up until then had been songs and chamber
music. 

Genre, as you might guess from the way it sounds, comes straight from French, a language based on
Latin. It's closely related to genus, a word you may have encountered in biology class. Both words
contain  the  gen-  root  because  they  indicate  that  everything  in  a  particular  category  (a  genre  or  a
genus) belongs to the same “family” and thus has the same origins. So the main genres of classical
music  would  include  symphonies,  sonatas,  and  opera,  and  the  major  genres  of  literature  would
include novels, short stories, poetry, and drama. But within the category of novels, we could also say
that detective novels, sci-fi novels, romance novels, and young-adult novels are separate genres.

- [[carcinogenic]] 

 Producing or causing cancer. 

• Although she knows all too well that the tobacco in cigarettes is carcinogenic, she's too addicted to
quit. 

It sometimes seems as if the list of carcinogenic substances gets longer every day. A substance such as
a  food  additive  that's  been  in  common  use  for  years  may  unexpectedly  show  signs  of  being
carcinogenic in laboratory experiments. When that happens, the suspected carcinogen will often have
to be withdrawn from the market. When a building material like asbestos turns out to be a carcinogen,
it  may  also  have  to  be  physically  removed  from  buildings.  English  has  hundreds  of  other  scientific
words ending in -genic (such as allergenic), and in almost all of them the ending means “causing.”
