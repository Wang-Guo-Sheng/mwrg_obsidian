- MUT  comes  from  the  Latin  mutare,  “to  change.”  Plenty  of  science-fiction  movies—Godzilla,  The
Fly, The Incredible Shrinking Man—used to be made on the subject of weird mutations, changes in
normal  people  or  animals  that  usually  end  up  causing  death  and  destruction.  What  causes  the
unfortunate  victim  to  mutate  may  be  a  mysterious  or  alien  force,  or  perhaps  invisible  radiation.
Though the science in these films isn't always right on target, the scare factor of an army of mutants
can be hard to beat.

- [[commute]] 
is less severe. (2) To travel back and forth regularly. 

 (1) To exchange or substitute; especially to change a penalty to another one that

• There was a public outcry at the harshness of the prison sentence, and two days later the governor
commuted it to five years. 

When you commute between a suburb and a city, you're “exchanging” one location for another. When
a chief executive substitutes a life sentence for the death sentence handed down by a court, he or she
is  commuting  the  original  sentence.  Most  such  commutations  are  the  result  of  the  prisoner's  good
behavior. A commutator is a device in many electric motors that regularly changes alternating current
to direct current.

- [[immutable]] 

 Not able or liable to change. 

• Early philosophers believed there was an immutable substance at the root of all existence. 

Mutable means simply “changeable,” so when the negative prefix im- [[is]] added we get its opposite. In
computer programming, an immutable object is one that can't be changed after it's been created. In a
constantly changing world, people who hunger for things as immutable as the laws of nature may try
to  observe  an  immutable  moral  code  and  set  of  values.  Unfortunately,  immutability  isn't  a  basic
quality of many things in this world.

- [[permutation]] 
variation. 

  A  change  in  the  order  of  a  set  of  objects;  rearrangement,

• They had rearranged the rooms in the house plans four or five times already, but the architect had
come up with yet another permutation. 

There are six permutations of the letters A, B, and C, selected two at a time: AB, AC, BC, BA, CA,
and  CB.  As  you  see,  order  is  important  in  permutations.  (By  contrast,  there  are  only  three
combinations: AB, AC, and BC.) Permutation is an important concept in mathematics, especially in
the  field  of  probability.  But  we  can  use  the  word  more  generally  to  mean  any  change  produced  by
rearranging  existing  parts  without  introducing  new  ones.  Some  soap  operas,  for  example,  love
permutations; the cast of regulars is constantly being rearranged into new pairs, and even triangles.

- [[transmute]] 
transform. (2) To experience such a change. 

 (1) To change in shape, appearance, or nature, especially for the better; to

• Working alone in his cluttered laboratory in 15th-century Milan, he spent twenty years searching for
a method of transmuting lead into gold. 

Transmutation changes something over into something else. Thus, a writer may transmute his life into
stories  or  novels,  and  an  arranger  might  transmute  a  lively  march  tune  into  a  quiet  lullaby.  In  the
“Myth of Er” at the end of Plato's Republic, for example, human souls are transmuted into the body
and existence of their choice. Having learned from their last life what they do not want to be, many
choose transmutation into something that seems better. A meek man chooses to be transmuted into a
tyrant, a farmer into a dashing (but short-lived) warrior, and so on. But very few seem to have learned
anything from their former life that would make their choice a real improvement.
