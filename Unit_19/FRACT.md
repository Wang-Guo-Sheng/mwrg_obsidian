- FRACT comes from the Latin verb frangere, “to break or shatter.” A fraction is one of the pieces
into which a whole can be broken, and a fracture is a break in a wall, a rock, or a bone.

- [[fractious]] 

 (1) Apt to cause trouble or be unruly. (2) Stirring up quarrels; irritable. 

• Shopping with a fractious child is next to impossible. 

One  of  the  earliest  meanings  of  fraction  was  “a  break  in  good  feeling”—that  is,  an  argument  or
conflict. So a person who starts fights could be called fractious. A fractious horse is one that hasn't
been  properly  broken  or  trained.  A  fractious  political  party  is  one  whose  members  keep  fighting
among themselves. And a fractious baby is one that's always breaking the home's peace and quiet with
angry squalling.

- [[fractal]] 

 An irregular shape that looks much the same at any scale on which it is examined. 

• He was showing her the fractals in the local ferns, in which each leaf reproduced the shape of the
entire fern. 

This term was coined in 1975 to describe shapes that seem to exist at both the small-scale and large-
scale levels in the same natural object. Fractals can be seen in snowflakes, in which the microscopic
crystals that make up a flake look much like the flake itself. They can also be seen in tree bark and in
broccoli buds. Coastlines often represent fractals as well, being highly uneven at both a large scale
and  a  very  small  scale.  Fractal  geometry  has  been  important  in  many  fields,  including  astronomy,
physical chemistry, and fluid mechanics. And even some artists are benefiting, creating beautiful and
interesting abstract designs by means of fractals.

- [[infraction]] 

 The breaking of a law or a violation of another's rights. 

• The assistant principal dealt with any students who had committed minor infractions of the rules. 

An  infraction  is  usually  the  breaking  of  a  law,  rule,  or  agreement.  So  a  nation  charged  with  an
infraction of an international treaty will usually have to pay a penalty. In Federal law, an infraction is
even  smaller  than  a  misdemeanor,  and  the  only  penalty  is  a  fine.  Most  of  us  occasionally  commit
infractions  of  parking  laws  and  get  ticketed;  speeding  tickets  are  usually  for  infractions  as  well,
though  they  go  on  a  permanent  record  and  can  end  up  costing  you  money  for  years  to  come.  The
closely  related  word  infringement  generally  refers  to  a  violation  of  a  right  or  privilege;  use  of
another's writings without permission, for example, may be an infringement of the copyright.

- [[refraction]] 
an angle from one substance into another in which its speed is different. 

 The change of direction of a ray of light or wave of energy as it passes at

•  From  where  I  was  standing,  the  refraction  made  it  look  as  if  her  legs  underwater  were  half  their
actual length. 

The  root  of  refraction  is  seen  in  the  notion  that  the  path  of  a  ray  of  light  or  wave  of  energy  is
“broken” when it is deflected or turned. The effects of refraction can be seen in a rainbow, which is
formed when light rays passing into (and reflecting out of) water droplets are bent at different angles
depending  on  their  color,  so  that  the  light  separates  into  bands  of  color.  The  amount  of  refraction
depends on the angle and the type of matter; refraction can occur even when passing through different
kinds of air. A mirage, such as you might see in the desert or over a patch of asphalt in the summer,
occurs when light passing through warm air meets the very hot air near the surface; reflecting the sky,
it often resembles a lake.

- TELE  has  as  its  basic  meanings  “distant”  or  “at  a  distance.”  A  telescope  is  for  looking  at  far-off
