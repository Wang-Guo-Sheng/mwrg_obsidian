- TELE  has  as  its  basic  meanings  “distant”  or  “at  a  distance.”  A  telescope  is  for  looking  at  far-off
objects; a camera's telephoto lens magnifies a distant scene for a photograph; and a television lets us
watch things taking place far away.

- [[telegenic]] 
and manner attractive to viewers. 

  Well-suited  to  appear  on  television,  especially  by  having  an  appearance

•  The  local  anchorpeople  all  have  telegenic  faces  and  great  hair,  though  they  don't  always  seem  to
know a lot about the economy or political science. 

The  word  telegenic,  a  blend  of  “television”  and  “photogenic,”  first  appeared  back  in  the  1930s,
before hardly anyone owned a TV. With the supreme importance of TV cameras in politics, people
running  for  political  office  today  worry  about  being  telegenic  enough  to  have  a  successful  career.
Even events have been described as telegenic; unfortunately, such events are often human tragedies,
such as fires, earthquakes, or floods, which happen to broadcast well and capture the interest of the
viewers.

- [[teleological]] 

 Showing or relating to design or purpose, especially in nature. 

•  Many  naturalists  object  to  the  teleological  view  that  sees  everything  in  nature  as  part  of  a  grand
design or plan. 

Teleology has the basic meaning “the study of ends or purposes.” So Aristotle's famous “teleological
argument”  claims  that  anything  complex  must  have  a  creator,  and  thus  that  God  exists.  And  a
teleological  explanation  of  evolutionary  changes  claims  that  all  such  changes  occur  for  a  definite
purpose. But the type of morality called “teleological ethics” doesn't involve God at all: instead, it
claims  that  we  should  judge  whether  an  act  is  good  or  bad  by  seeing  if  it  produces  a  good  or  bad
result, even if the act involves harming or killing another person.

- [[telemetry]] 
  The  science  or  process  of  measuring  such  things  as  pressure,  speed,  or
temperature, sending the result usually by radio to a distant station, and recording the measurements
there. 

• The telemetry of the satellite had gone dead in 1999, and its fate remains a mystery. 

Telemetry  is  used  to  obtain  data  on  the  internal  functioning  of  missiles,  rockets,  unmanned  planes,
satellites,  and  probes,  providing  data  on  such  factors  as  position,  altitude,  and  speed  as  well  as
conditions  like  temperature,  air  pressure,  wind  speed,  and  radiation.  Weather  forecasters  rely  on
telemetry to map weather patterns. Astronauts on the space shuttle are monitored with telemetry that
measures and transmits readings on their blood pressure, respiration, and heart rates. Similar kinds of
telemetry are used by biologists to study animals in the wild and keep track of their populations and
movements. Telemetry is also widely used in modern agriculture, often to regulate irrigation.

- [[telecommute]] 

 To work at home using an electronic link with a central office. 

• A dozen of our employees are now telecommuting, and we calculate that altogether they're saving 25
gallons of gasoline and its pollution every day. 

This word has been around since the early 1970s, when computer terminals in the home first began to
be connected to so-called mainframe computers by telephone lines. Since the creation of the World
Wide  Web  in  1991,  and  with  the  widening  access  to  broadband  connections,  telecommuting  has
grown  to  the  point  that  the  U.S.  is  now  home  to  many  millions  of  occasional  telecommuters.
Telecommuting  can  make  work  much  easier  for  people  with  young  children  and  people  with
disabilities, and because of its obvious environmental benefits and the lessening of traffic congestion,
telecommuting is now officially encouraged by federal legislation. Still, only a fraction of those who
could be telecommuting are actually doing so.
