BIO comes from the Greek word for “life,” and forms the base for many English words. Biology, for
instance, is the study of living forms and life processes; the biosphere is the entire area of and above
the  earth  where  life  can  exist;  and  biotechnology  is  the  use  of  living  organisms  to  create  useful
products.

- [[bionic]] 

 Made stronger or more capable by electronic or mechanical devices. 

•  Bionic  feet  and  hands  for  amputees  have  ceased  to  be  mere  sci-fi  fantasies  and  are  becoming
realities. 

The science of bionics uses knowledge about how biological systems work to help solve engineering
problems. The material Velcro, for example, was inspired by the way burrs behave when they stick to
your clothes, and some computer chips are now wired in ways that imitate the “wiring” of the brain
and nervous system. But in popular use, the adjective bionic almost always describes artificial limbs
or other bodily parts that work as much like real ones as possible. A perfect bionic arm would move
and function as easily as a real arm—a goal we're rapidly getting closer to.

- [[biopsy]] 

 The removal and examination of tissue, cells, or fluids from a living body. 

• Everyone felt relieved when the results of the biopsy showed the tumor wasn't cancerous. 

Matter examined in a biopsy is always taken from a living organism. Most biopsies are done by using
a  needle  to  extract  tissue  or  fluid,  but  some  may  instead  require  cutting,  and  others  may  amount  to
nothing more than swabbing the inside of the patient's cheek. Biopsies are best known as a means of
detecting cancer, but a doctor may also take a biopsy of heart muscle to investigate suspected heart
disease, for example, or perform a biopsy on a pregnant woman to test for disorders in the fetus.

- [[biodegradable]] 
microorganisms or other living things. 

  Able  to  be  broken  down  into  harmless  substances  by

• Though the advertisements promised that the entire package was biodegradable, environmentalists
expressed their doubts. 

In biodegradable, with its root grad, “to step or move,” and its prefix de- “downward,” we get an
adjective  describing  things  that  can  be  broken  down  into  basic  substances  through  normal
environmental  processes.  Animal  and  plant  products  are  normally  biodegradable,  but  mineral
substances  such  as  metals,  glass,  and  plastics  usually  are  not.  Newly  developed  biodegradable
plastics  are  now  appearing  in  numerous  products.  However,  “biodegradable”  products  can  vary
greatly in how long they take to break down. A loaf of bread may require only a couple of weeks, and
a piece of paper may vanish in a couple of months, but some “biodegradable” plastic milk cartons
may take four or five years.

- [[symbiosis]] 
benefits both. (2) A cooperative relationship between two people or groups. 

 (1) The close living together of two different forms of life in a way that

•  The  lichen  that  grows  on  rocks  is  produced  by  the  symbiosis  of  a  fungus  and  an  alga,  two  very
different organisms. 

With  its  prefix  sym-,  “with,”  symbiosis  expresses  the  notion  of  cooperation  between  living  things.
Symbiotic  associations  are  found  throughout  the  plant  and  animal  world.  You  may  have  read,  for
instance, of the little blackbird plover, which picks the teeth of the fierce African crocodile. Or the
bird called the African honeyguide, which leads a little mammal called the ratel to a bees' nest, which
the  ratel,  protected  from  the  bees  by  its  thick  fur,  then  breaks  open,  and  both  it  and  the  honeyguide
feast on the honey. Or even our own bodies, which are home to millions of bacteria—especially the
bacterium E. coli in our intestines—and neither we nor E. coli could live without the other. You can
probably think of plenty of human relationships that could be called symbiotic as well.

- GEN, which comes from the Greek genos, meaning “birth,” has generated dozens of English words.
