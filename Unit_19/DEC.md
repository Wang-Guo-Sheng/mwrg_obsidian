DEC comes from both Greek and Latin and means “ten.” So a decade lasts for ten years; the decimal
system is based on ten; and a decahedron is a geometrical shape with ten sides.

• At 15 she posted a decalogue of life rules on her bedroom door, starting with “1. Be respectful to
teachers.” 

In  decalogue  the  root  deca-  is  combined  with  logos,  Greek  for  “word.”  In  the  Biblical  book  of
Exodus,  the  original  Decalogue,  or  Ten  Commandments,  was  handed  to  Moses  by  God  atop  Mount
Sinai. In Jewish and Christian tradition, the Ten Commandments are regarded as laws handed down
from the highest authority and as the foundation of morality. They include commands to honor God, the
Sabbath  day,  and  one's  parents,  and  bans  on  worshiping  images,  swearing,  murder,  adultery,  theft,
lying  about  others,  and  envying  what  others  have.  Individuals  have  often  had  their  own  personal
decalogues;  Thomas  Jefferson's  “ten  commandments”  started  off  with  “Never  put  off  till  tomorrow
what you can do today.”

- [[decathlon]] 

 An athletic contest made up of ten parts. 

•  Though  the  U.S.  has  dominated  the  Olympic  decathlon  for  its  whole  modern  history,  the  1948
victory by the 17-year-old Bob Mathias still astonished the world. 

Decathlon from deca- [[and]] athlon, “contest,” means “ten contests.” The ancient Greek Olympics held
five-contest competitions, or pentathlons, that were based on the skills needed in battle. The modern
Olympic  decathlon,  which  was  born  in  1912,  consists  of  the  100-meter  run,  400-meter  run,  1500-
meter run, 110-meter high hurdles, javelin throw, discus throw, shot put, pole vault, high jump, and
long jump. The original winner was the legendary Jim Thorpe, who would later be judged the greatest
American athlete of the 20th century. And ever since, the Olympic decathlon winner has been called
the finest all-around athlete in the world.

- [[decibel]] 
  A  unit  based  on  a  scale  ranging  from  0  to  about  130  used  to  measure  the
loudness of sound, with 0 indicating the least sound that can be heard and 130 the average level that
causes pain. 

• She worries about the damage that high decibel levels can cause, and always wears ear protection
when mowing the lawn. 

The bel in decibel honors the inventor of the telephone, Alexander Graham Bell. Decibels work on a
logarithmic scale (you may need to look up logarithm), so 20 decibels is 10 times as strong as 10
decibels,  and  50  decibels  is  1,000  times  as  strong  as  20  decibels.  The  decibel  readings  of  some
everyday  sounds  make  for  interesting  comparisons.  Whispers  and  rustling  leaves  usually  register
under  20  decibels,  the  average  level  of  conversation  is  about  50  decibels,  and  noisy  factories  or
office machinery may have decibel levels of 90 to 100. In the category of sounds between 100 and
120  decibels,  which  can  eventually  cause  deafness,  we  find  elevated  trains,  artillery—and  rock
concerts.

- [[decimate]] 

 To reduce drastically or destroy most of. 

•  Before  the  developments  of  modern  medicine,  diphtheria  and  typhoid  could  decimate  the
populations of entire towns and cities. 

Commanders  in  the  Roman  army  took  discipline  seriously.  Mutiny  in  the  ranks  was  dealt  with  by
selecting, through drawing lots, one soldier in every ten and making the other nine club or stone the
unfortunate winner of this gruesome lottery to death. The dec- [[in]] decimate thus reflects this Roman
practice,  which  was  ordered  by  such  well-known  leaders  as  Crassus,  Mark  Antony,  and  Augustus.
But over time, the word's meaning has shifted, and today it almost always describes great destruction
or  loss  of  life.  So,  for  example,  we  can  say  that  a  wave  of  layoffs  has  decimated  a  company's
workforce,  the  populations  of  some  of  Africa's  greatest  wild  animals  have  been  decimated  by
poaching, or aerial bombardment has decimated whole sections of a city.
