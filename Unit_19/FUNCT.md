- FUNCT comes from the Latin verb fungi, “to perform, carry out.” If your car is functional, it's able
to perform its function of providing transportation. But a functional illiterate is a person who, for all
practical or functional purposes, might as well not be able to read or write at all.

- [[functionary]] 
holds a position in a political party or government. 

  (1)  Someone  who  performs  a  certain  function.  (2)  Someone  who

• He was one of a group of party functionaries assigned to do the dirty work of the campaign. 

For  most  of  us,  being  described  as  a  functionary  wouldn't  be  a  compliment.  The  word  refers
especially to a person of lower rank, with little or no authority, who must carry out someone else's
orders. Bureaucrat  is  often  a  synonym.  However,  functionary  can  also  refer  to  the  world  beyond
government  and  offices;  a  character  in  a  play,  for  example,  could  be  called  a  functionary  if  it  was
obvious that her sole function was to keep the plot moving.

- [[malfunction]] 

 To fail to operate in the normal or usual manner. 

• An examination of the wreck revealed that the brakes may have malfunctioned as the truck started
down the hill. 

A  malfunctioning  switch  might  keep  us  from  turning  on  a  light.  A  malfunctioning  heart  valve  might
require replacement with an artificial valve, and if your immune system malfunctions it may start to
attack healthy cells. And a malfunction in a voting machine could result in hundreds of votes being
miscounted.

- [[defunct]] 

 No longer, living, existing, or functioning. 

• The company, which had once had annual sales of $150 million, was now defunct. 

If you know that de- [[often]] means “the opposite of” (see DE), it's easy to guess the meaning of defunct.
Shakespeare seems to have been the first writer to use this adjective, in Henry V. Defunct American
political  parties  include  the  Greenback  Party,  the  Readjuster  Party,  and  the  Nullifier  Party.  Defunct
Academy Awards categories include Best Dance Direction and Best Assistant Director. Defunct U.S.
auto  models  include  the  Dudly  Bug,  the  LuLu,  the  Hupmobile,  the  Gas-au-lec,  and  the  Nu-Klea
Starlite. But to speak of a person as defunct would sound disrespectful—which is how it sounds in e.
e. cummings's famous poem “Buffalo Bill's defunct.”

- [[dysfunctional]] 
within a group of people. (2) Being unable to function in a normal way. 

  (1)  Showing  abnormal  or  unhealthy  behaviors  and  attitudes

•  A  psychologist  would  call  their  family  dysfunctional,  but  even  though  there's  a  lot  of  yelling  and
slamming of doors, they seem pretty happy to me. 

Dysfunctional and dysfunction have been used for almost a hundred years, often in medical writing
(“brain  dysfunction,”  “a  dysfunctional  liver”)  but  also  by  social  scientists  (“a  dysfunctional  city
council,” “diplomatic dysfunction”). But they only really entered the general vocabulary in the 1980s,
when therapists and talk-show hosts began talking about dysfunctional families. The signs of family
dysfunction turned out to be numerous, and it soon began to seem as if pretty much all our families
could be called dysfunctional.

- MUT  comes  from  the  Latin  mutare,  “to  change.”  Plenty  of  science-fiction  movies—Godzilla,  The
