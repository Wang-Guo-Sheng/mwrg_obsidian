- CENT, from the Latin centum, means “one hundred.” A dollar is made up of a hundred cents, though
other monetary systems use centavos or centimes as the smallest coin. A centipede has what appears
to be a hundred feet, though the actual number varies greatly. But there really are a hundred years in a
century.

- [[centenary]] 

 A 100th anniversary or the celebration of it; a centennial. 

• The company is celebrating the centenary of its founding with a lavish banquet. 

A  centenary,  like  its  cousin  centennial,  is  an  anniversary.  Thus,  the  year  2013  may  mark  the
centenary of a town's founding, and the year-long calendar of public events that the town sponsors for
the occasion—that is, the celebration of the anniversary—can also be called a centenary. Individuals
have their own centenaries, which usually celebrate their births; thus, Gerald Ford's centenary will
occur in 2013, and John Kennedy's in 2017. And if you live long enough to be a centenarian, you'll
be around to join the celebrations.

- [[centigrade]] 
and 100° is its boiling point. 

 Relating to a temperature scale in which 0° is the freezing point of water

• The normal temperature of a human body is 37° centigrade. 

The  centigrade  scale  is  essentially  identical  to  the  Celsius  scale,  the  standard  scale  by  which
temperature is measured in most of the world. Anders Celsius of Sweden first devised the centigrade
scale in the early 18th century. But in his version, 100° marked the freezing point of water, and 0° its
boiling point. Later users found it less confusing to reverse these two. To convert Fahrenheit degrees
to centigrade, subtract 32 and multiply by 5/9. To convert centigrade to Fahrenheit, multiply by 9/5
and add 32.

- [[centimeter]] 

 A length measuring 1/100th of a meter, or about 0.39 inch. 

• There are 2.54 centimeters in an inch, 30.48 centimeters in a foot. 

In  the  metric  system,  which  is  used  in  most  countries  of  the  world,  each  basic  unit  of  measure  of
length, area, or volume can be divided into centimeters. A meter consists of 100 centimeters, a square
meter  consists  of  10,000  square  centimeters,  and  a  cubic  meter  consists  of  1,000,000  cubic
centimeters.

- [[centurion]] 
soldiers. 

 The officer in command of a Roman century, originally a troop of 100

• Centurions and their centuries were the backbone of the great Roman armies. 

In ancient Rome, a century was approximately equal to a company in the U.S. Army, and a centurion
was roughly equivalent to a captain. Centurions play a role in the New Testament; Jesus performs a
miracle for a centurion in Capernaum, centurions are present at the crucifixion, and in later years St.
Paul is arrested by centurions. According to a writer of the time, centurions were chosen for their size
and strength, their abilities at swordplay and at throwing missiles, and the quality of their discipline,
which was partly shown by how well their soldiers kept their own armor polished.
