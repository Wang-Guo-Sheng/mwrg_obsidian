- PHIL comes from the Greek word meaning “love.” In philosophy, it's joined with sophia, “wisdom,”
so  philosophy  means  literally  “love  of  wisdom.”  When  joined  with  biblio-,  “book,”  the  result  is
bibliophile, or “lover of books.” And Philadelphia, containing the Greek word adelphos, “brother,”
was named by its Quaker founder, William Penn, as the city of “brotherly love.”

- [[oenophile]] 

 A person with an appreciation and usually knowledge of fine wine. 

• As an amateur oenophile, he was constantly talking to his friends in the vocabulary of wine tasting. 

The root oeno- [[comes]] from the Greek word meaning “wine.” The oenophile should be distinguished
from the oenologist, or “student of wine,” who has a technical knowledge of the cultivation of wine
grapes and of the whole winemaking process. Oenophiles may not know how to make a great wine,
but  they  know  one  when  they  taste  it.  Not  only  that,  but  they  can  describe  it  using  nouns  like  nose,
finish, and bouquet, as well as adjectives such as woody, full-bodied, robust, and noble.

- [[philatelist]] 

 A person who collects or studies stamps. 

• The U.S. Postal Service issues first-day covers of each new stamp design especially for philatelists.

The first postage stamps were made available on May 1, 1840, in England, and it didn't take long for
the hobby of stamp collecting to arise. Within a year, a young London lady was letting it be known in
a  newspaper  advertisement  that  she  was  “desirous  of  covering  her  dressing  room  with  cancelled
postage stamps.” Philately has been alive and well ever since, though modern philatelists—including
rock stars, English kings, and American presidents—are more likely to put the stamps they collect in
special albums.

- Anglophile 

 A person who greatly admires or favors England and English things. 

•  His  grandparents  were  Anglophiles,  and  whenever  they  had  guests  in  the  afternoon  the  beautiful
silver tea service would come out. 

Even  after  fighting  two  wars  against  Britain,  Americans  continued  to  regard  England  with  more
fondness than perhaps any other country. For much of our history, Americans have sought to imitate
the British in any number of ways—American movie stars even used to adopt British accents—and
the two countries have long been close allies. But Britain isn't the only country Americans fall in love
with;  Francophiles  (France-lovers),  Germanophiles  (Germany-lovers),  and  Italophiles  (Italy-
lovers)  are  also  common.  In  the  19th  century,  Russian  Slavophiles  called  for  rejecting  European
culture in favor of homegrown Russian culture (Slavs being those who speak a Slavic language such
as  Russian  or  Polish).  Occasionally  phil-  words  are  turned  around;  thus,  someone  who  is
philosemitic is a lover of Jewish culture.

- [[philanthropy]] 
is supported by charitable contributions. 

 (1) A charitable act or gift. (2) An organization that distributes or

• Her last philanthropy was dedicated to protecting a vast area in central Africa where many of the
great apes lived. 

With  its  anthro-  root  (see  ANTHROP),  philanthropy  means  literally  “love  of  mankind.”  Thus,
philanthropy  is  giving  money  for  a  purpose  or  cause  benefiting  people  who  you  don't  personally
know.  (Animals  are  usually  included  as  well.)  Individuals  have  often  set  up  their  own  permanent
philanthropic organizations in the form of foundations. The greatest American philanthropists have
included Warren Buffett, Bill Gates, Andrew Carnegie, and John D. Rockefeller, but tens of millions
of us could be considered philanthropists on a much smaller scale.
