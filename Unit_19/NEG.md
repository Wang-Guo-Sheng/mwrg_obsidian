- NEG  and  its  variants  nec-  and  ne-  are  prefixes  of  denial  or  refusal  in  Latin,  and  the  Latin  verb
negare  means  “to  say  no.”  To  negate  something  is  to  make  it  ineffective,  and  something  negative
denies, contradicts, refuses, or reverses.

- [[negligent]] 
neglect. 

 (1) Failing to take proper or normal care. (2) Marked by or likely to show

• The Army Corps of Engineers was found negligent for having failed to keep the New Orleans levees
in good repair. 

To be negligent is to be neglectful. Negligence is an important legal concept; it's usually defined as
the failure to use the care that a normally careful person would in a given situation. Negligence is a
common claim in lawsuits regarding medical malpractice, auto accidents, and workplace injuries. But
you  can  also  be  negligent  about  answering  your  e-mail,  or  negligent  in  the  way  you  dress.  (The
original garment called a negligee was worn by women who had neglected to get fully dressed.) The
legal meanings of negligent and negligence, however, tend to be the ones we most often encounter
nowadays.

- [[abnegation]] 

 Self-denial. 

• She's been denying herself pleasures since she was a child, so she's actually attracted by the life of
abnegation that a nun leads. 

Abnegation  plays  an  important  part  in  the  teachings  of  all  the  major  religions.  The  founder  of
Buddhism was a prince who gave up all his worldly goods when he discovered the world of poverty
that lay outside the palace gates, and abnegation has been a Buddhism practice ever since. Hinduism
has  an  even  older  tradition  of  abnegation.  Special  periods  of  abnegation  and  fasting  may  even  be
included  in  a  religion's  yearly  calendar;  serious  Christians  give  up  some  pleasure  for  the  40-day
period of Lent, for instance, and Muslims are forbidden to eat during daylight hours during the month
of Ramadan.

- [[negligible]] 

 So small as to be neglected or disregarded. 

• Local weather forecasters had made it sound like the blizzard of the century, but the amount of snow
turned out to be negligible. 

Negligible  comes  from  the  same  Latin  verb  as  neglect,  so  something  negligible  is  literally
“neglectable.” If an accident results in negligible damage to your car, you should be thankful. If two
years of intense focus on testing in the classroom results in a negligible improvement in student test
scores, it's probably time to try something new.

- [[renege]] 

 To go back on a promise or commitment. 

• If his partners renege at this point, the whole project will probably fall through. 

To renege on a bet is to refuse to pay up when you lose. To renege on a promise of marriage, or on a
deal of any kind, is to pull out. History is full of promises and commitments and treaties that were
reneged  on,  such  as  the  many  treaties  with  Native  Americans  that  American  settlers  and  the  U.S.
government  went  back  on  over  a  period  of  almost  300  years.  A  synonym  is  welsh  (“He  always
welshes on his deals”); however, since that word may have come from Welsh, meaning a native of
Wales in Britain, some people think it might be offensive.
