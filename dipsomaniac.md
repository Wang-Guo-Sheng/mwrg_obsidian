酗酒成瘾者

A person with an extreme and uncontrollable desire for alcohol. 

• She didn't like the word **alcoholic** being applied to her, and liked dipsomaniac even less. 

Dipsomaniac comes from the Greek noun *dipsa*, “thirst,” but thirst usually has nothing to do with it.
Some  experts  distinguish  between  an  alcoholic  and  a  dipsomaniac,  reserving  dipsomaniac  for someone involved in frequent episodes of **binge** drinking and blackouts. In any case, there are plenty of  less  respectful  words  for  a  person  of  similar  habits:  *sot,  lush,  wino,  souse,  boozer,  guzzler, tippler, tosspot, drunkard, boozehound*--the list goes on and on and on.
