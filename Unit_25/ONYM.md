- ONYM comes from the Greek onyma, meaning “name, word.” An anonymous donor or writer is one
who  isn't  named.  A  synonym  is  a  word  with  the  same  meaning  as  another  word  (see  SYN).  And
homonyms (see HOM/HOMO) are words that look and sound alike but aren't actually related, such as
well (“healthy”) and well (“a deep hole with water in it”).

- [[antonym]] 

 A word that means the opposite of some other word. 

• There's no point in telling a three-year-old that cat isn't an antonym of dog, and sun isn't an antonym
of moon. 

Antonym includes the Greek prefix ant-, meaning “opposite” (see ANT/ANTI). Antonyms are often
thought of in pairs: hot/cold, up/down, wet/dry, buy/sell, failure/success. But a word may have more
than one antonym (old/young, old/new), especially when one of the words has synonyms (small/large,
small/big, little/big), and a word may have many approximate antonyms (adore/hate, adore/detest,
adore/loathe). But although lots of words have synonyms, not so many have antonyms. What would
be the antonym of pink? weather? semipro? thirty? firefighter? wax? about? consider?

- [[eponymous]] 

 Of, relating to, or being the person for whom something is named. 

• Adjectives such as Elizabethan, Victorian, and Edwardian show how the names of certain British
monarchs have become eponymous for particular time periods and styles. 

Things as different as a bird, a river, and a drug may be named to honor someone. The Canadian city
of Vancouver was named after the explorer George Vancouver; the diesel engine was named for its
inventor, Rudolph Diesel; Alzheimer's disease was named after the physician Alois Alzheimer; and
so on. Common eponymous terms include Ohm's law, Parkinson's Law, and the Peter Principle. And
if  the  Beatles'  famous  “white  album”  actually  has  a  name,  it's  usually  called  “The  Beatles,”  which
means that it's eponymous as well. Don't be surprised if eponymous turns out to be a hard word to
use; lots of other people have discovered the same thing.

- [[patronymic]] 
ancestors. 

 Part of a personal name based on the name of one's father or one of his

• Reading Tolstoy's vast novel, it can be helpful to know that Helene Vasilievna's second name is a
patronymic, and thus that her father is named Vasili. 

A patronymic, or patronym (see also PATER/PATR), is generally formed by adding a prefix or suffix
to  a  name.  Thus,  a  few  centuries  ago,  the  male  patronymic  of  Patrick  was  Fitzpatrick  (“Patrick's
son”), that of Peter was Peterson or Petersen, that of Donald was MacDonald or McDonald, and that
of Hernando was Hernández. Today, of course, each of these is an ordinary family name, or surname.
In Russia, both a patronymic and a surname are still used; in the name Peter Ilyich Tchaikovsky, for
example, Ilyich is a patronymic meaning “son of Ilya.”

- [[pseudonym]] 
name. 

  A  name  that  someone  (such  as  a  writer)  uses  instead  of  his  or  her  real

•  Hundreds  of  Hardy  Boys,  Nancy  Drew,  and  Bobbsey  Twins  novels  were  churned  out  under  such
pseudonyms as Franklin W. Dixon, Carolyn Keene, and Laura Lee Hope. 

The Greek pseudo- [[is]] used in English to mean “false,” or sometimes “resembling.” A pseudonym is
thus  a  false  name,  or  alias.  A  writer's  pseudonym  is  called  a  pen name,  as  in  the  case  of  Howard
O'Brien  (who  usually  writes  as  “Anne  Rice”  but  sometimes  under  other  names),  and  an  actor's
pseudonym is called a stage name, as in the case of Marion Morrison (“John Wayne”). A cadre name
may be used for the sake of secrecy by a revolutionary plotter such as Vladimir Ulyanov (“Lenin”) or
Iosif  Dzhugashvili  (“Stalin”).  And  in  many  religious  orders,  members  adopt  devotional  names,  as
Agnes Bojaxhiu did in 1931 (“Teresa,” later known as “Mother Teresa”).
