- SCRIB/SCRIP comes from the Latin verb scribere, “to write.” Scribble is an old word meaning to
write or draw carelessly. A written work that hasn't been published is a manuscript. And to describe
is to picture something in words.

- [[conscription]] 
draft. 

  Enforced  enlistment  of  persons,  especially  for  military  service;

•  The  first  comprehensive  system  for  nationwide  conscription  was  instituted  by  France  for  the
Napoleonic wars that followed the French Revolution. 

With  its  scrip-  root,  conscription  means  basically  writing  someone's  name  on  a  list—a  list  that,
unfortunately,  a  lot  of  people  usually  don't  want  to  be  on.  Conscription  has  existed  at  least  since
ancient  Egypt's  Old  Kingdom  (27th  century  B.C.),  though  universal  conscription  has  been  rare
throughout  history.  Forms  of  conscription  were  used  by  Prussia,  Switzerland,  Russia,  and  other
European powers in the 17th and 18th centuries. In the U.S., conscription was first applied during the
Civil War, by both the North and the South. In the North there were pockets of resistance, and the draft
led to riots in several cities. The U.S. abandoned conscription at the end of the war and didn't revive
it until World War I.

- [[circumscribe]] 
a line around or to surround with a boundary. 

 (1) To clearly limit the range or activity of something. (2) To draw

•  Some  children  do  best  when  their  freedom  is  clearly  circumscribed  and  their  activities  are
supervised. 

The prefix circum-, “around,” is the key to circumscribe's basic meaning. Thus, we could say that a
boxing ring is circumscribed by ropes, just as the area for an archaeological dig may be. A governor's
power  is  always  circumscribed  by  a  state's  constitution.  And  a  physician's  assistant  has  a
circumscribed role that doesn't include writing prescriptions.

- [[inscription]] 
on a building, coin, medal, or piece of currency. (2) The dedication of a book or work of art. 

  (1)  Something  permanently  written,  engraved,  or  printed,  particularly

• All U.S. coins bear the Latin inscription “E pluribus unum”—“From many, one.” 

With its prefix in-, meaning “in” or “on,” it's not surprising that an inscription is either written on or
engraved  into  a  surface.  Inscriptions  in  the  ancient  world  were  always  chiseled  into  stone,  as
inscriptions still may be today. The principal monument of the Vietnam memorial in Washington, D.C.,
for instance, is a black wall on which are inscribed the names of all the Americans who died during
the  war—each  name  in  full,  row  upon  seemingly  endless  row.  But  an  inscription  may  also  be  a
dedication,  such  as  the  words  “For  my  wife”  all  by  themselves  on  a  page  near  the  beginning  of  a
book.

- [[proscribe]] 

 To forbid as harmful or unlawful; prohibit. 

•  Despite  thousands  of  laws  proscribing  littering,  many  of  America's  streets  and  public  spaces
continue to be dumping grounds. 

The Latin prefix pro- [[sometimes]] meant “before,” in the sense of “in front of” the people. So in ancient
Rome  proscribere  meant  to  make  public  in  writing  the  name  of  a  person  who  was  about  to  be
executed, and whose property would be seized by the state. But the meaning of the English word soon
shifted to mean simply “prohibit” instead. Proscribe today is actually often the opposite of the very
similar prescribe, which means basically “require.”

- FALL  comes  from  the  Latin  verb  fallere,  “to  deceive.”  It's  actually  at  the  root  of  the  word  false,
