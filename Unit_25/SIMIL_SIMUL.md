- SIMIL/SIMUL come from the Latin adjective similis, meaning “like, resembling, similar,” and the
verb simulare, “to make like.” Two similar things resemble each other. Two simultaneous activities
proceed at the same time. And a facsimile, such as you might receive from your fax machine, looks
exactly the same as the original.

- [[simile]] 
between two things different in all other respects. 

  A  figure  of  speech,  introduced  by  as  or  like,  that  makes  a  point  of  comparison

• He particularly liked the simile he'd thought of for the last line of the song's chorus, “It felt like a
bullet in his heart.” 

Fiction,  poetry,  and  philosophy  have  been  full  of  similes  for  centuries.  In  fact,  the  oldest  literature
known  to  us  uses  similes,  along  with  their  close  relatives  known  as  metaphors  (see  metaphorical).
This  suggests  that  similes  are  an  essential  part  of  imaginative  writing  in  all  times  and  all  cultures.
When  Tennyson,  describing  an  eagle,  writes  “And  like  a  thunderbolt  he  falls,”  he's  using  a  simile,
since the line makes a specific comparison. “The road was a ribbon of moonlight” could be called a
metaphor, though “The road was like a ribbon of moonlight” would be a simile.

- [[assimilate]] 
different society or culture. 

 (1) To take in and thoroughly understand. (2) To cause to become part of a

• One of the traditional strengths of American society has been its ability to assimilate one group of
immigrants after another. 

Assimilate comes from the Latin verb assimulare, “to make similar,” and it originally applied to the
process by which food is taken into the body and absorbed into the system. In a similar way, a fact
can  be  taken  into  the  mind,  thoroughly  digested,  and  absorbed  into  one's  store  of  knowledge.  A
newcomer to a job or a subject must assimilate an often confusing mass of information; only after it's
been thoroughly absorbed can the person make intelligent use of it. An immigrant family assimilates
into its new culture by gradually adopting a new language and the habits of their new neighbors—a
process that's always easier for the children than for the parents.

- [[simulacrum]] 

 A copy, especially a superficial likeness or imitation. 

• As a boy he had filled his bedroom with model fighter jets, and these simulacra had kept his flying
fantasies active for years. 

In its original meaning, a simulacrum is simply a representation of something else; so an original oil
painting, marble statue, or plastic figurine could all be simulacra (notice the plural form) in the old
sense.  But  today  the  word  usually  means  a  copy  that's  meant  to  substitute  for  the  real  thing—and
usually a cheap and inferior copy, a pale imitation of the original. So in old Persia a beautifully laid
out  garden  was  a  simulacrum  of  paradise.  Some  countries'  governments  are  mere  simulacra  of
democracy, since the people in power always steal the elections by miscounting the votes. And a bad
actor might do a simulacrum of grief on the stage that doesn't convince anyone.

- [[simulate]] 
deceive. (2) To make a realistic imitation of something, such as a physical environment. 

  (1)  To  take  on  the  appearance  or  effect  of  something,  often  in  order  to

• The armed services have made extensive use of video games to simulate the actual experience of
warfare for their recruits. 

The zircon, that favorite of home shopping channels, simulates a diamond—more or less. A skilled
furrier  can  dye  lower-grade  furs  to  simulate  real  mink.  A  skilled  actress  can  simulate  a  range  of
emotions from absolute joy to crushing despair. And an apparatus that simulates the hazards of driving
while intoxicated is likely to provide some very real benefits.
