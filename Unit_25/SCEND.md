- SCEND comes from the Latin verb scandere, “to climb.” The staircase we ascend to our bedroom at
night we will descend the next morning, since what goes up must come down.

- [[transcend]] 

 To rise above the limits of; overcome, surpass. 

• His defeat in the election had been terribly hard on him, and it took two years before he finally felt
he had transcended the bitterness it had produced. 

Great  leaders  are  expected  to  transcend  the  limitations  of  politics,  especially  during  wartime  and
national  crises.  A  great  writer  may  transcend  geographical  boundaries  to  become  internationally
respected. And certain laws of human nature seem to transcend historical periods and hold true for all
times and all places.

- [[condescend]] 
if superior. 

 (1) To stoop to a level of lesser importance or dignity. (2) To behave as

• Every so often my big brother would condescend to take me to a movie, but only when my parents
made him. 

Back  when  society  was  more  rigidly  structured,  condescend  didn't  sound  so  negative.  People  of
higher rank, power, or social position had to overlook certain established rules of behavior if they
wished  to  have  social  dealings  with  people  of  lower  status,  but  such  condescension  was  usually
gracious  and  courteous.  In  today's  more  classless  society,  the  term  implies  a  manner  that  may  be
slightly offensive. A poor relation is unlikely to be grateful to a wealthy and condescending relative
who passes on her secondhand clothes, and employees at an office party may not be thrilled when the
boss's wife condescends to mingle with them. Often the word is used rather unseriously, as when a
friend comments that a snooty sales clerk condescended to wait on her after ignoring her for several
minutes.

- [[descendant]] 
One deriving directly from a forerunner or original. 

 (1) One that has come down from another or from a common stock. (2)

• Though none of the great man's descendants ever came close to achieving what he had, most of them
enjoyed very respectable careers. 

Descendant is the opposite of ancestor. Your grandparents' descendants are those who are descended
from them—your parents, your brothers and sisters, and any children that any of you may have. It's
been claimed that every person on earth is a descendant of Muhammad, and of every historical person
before him—Julius Caesar, the Buddha, etc.—who started a line of descent. (Some of us still find this
hard to believe.) And not all descendants are human; every modern thesaurus, for example, could be
called the descendant of the one devised by Peter Mark Roget in 1852.

- [[ascendancy]] 

 Governing or controlling interest; domination. 

• China's growing ascendancy over Tibet was capped by the invasion of 1950. 

In  the  course  of  a  year,  the  sun  appears  to  pass  through  the  twelve  constellations  of  the  zodiac  in
sequence, and all the planets also lie close to the solar path. The constellation and planet that are just
rising, or ascendant, above the eastern horizon in the sun's path at the moment of a child's birth are
said by astrologers to exercise a lifelong controlling influence over the child. This is the idea that lies
at the heart of ascendancy, though the word today no longer hints at supernatural powers.

- ONYM comes from the Greek onyma, meaning “name, word.” An anonymous donor or writer is one
