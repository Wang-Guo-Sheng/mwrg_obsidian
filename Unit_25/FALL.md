- FALL  comes  from  the  Latin  verb  fallere,  “to  deceive.”  It's  actually  at  the  root  of  the  word  false,
which we rarely use today to mean “deceptive,” though that meaning does show up in older phrases:
“Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbor,” for instance, or “A false-hearted lover will
send you to your grave.” Fallere is even at the root of fail and fault, though you might not guess it to
look at them.

- [[fallacy]] 

 A wrong belief; a false or mistaken idea. 

• In her new article she exposes yet another fallacy at the heart of these economic arguments. 

Philosophers are constantly using the word fallacy. For them, a fallacy is reasoning that comes to a
conclusion  without  the  evidence  to  support  it.  This  may  have  to  do  with  pure  logic,  with  the
assumptions that the argument is based on, or with the way words are used, especially if they don't
keep exactly the same meaning throughout the argument. There are many classic fallacies that occur
again  and  again  through  the  centuries  and  everywhere  in  the  world.  You  may  have  heard  of  such
fallacies  as  the  “ad  hominem”  fallacy,  the  “question-begging”  fallacy,  the  “straw  man”  fallacy,  the
“slippery slope” fallacy, the “gambler's” fallacy, or the “red herring” fallacy. Look them up and see if
you've ever been guilty of any of them.

- [[fallacious]] 

 Containing a mistake; not true or accurate. 

• Any policy that's based on a lot of fallacious assumptions is going to be a bad one. 

Fallacious is a formal and intellectual word. We rarely use it in casual speech; when we do, we risk
sounding a bit full of ourselves and all-knowing. But it's used widely in writing, especially when one
writer is arguing with another. And it's used to describe both errors in fact and errors in reasoning,
including fallacies of the kind described in the previous entry.

- [[fallibility]] 

 Capability of making mistakes or being wrong. 

•  Doctors  are  concerned  about  the  fallibility  of  these  tests,  which  seem  unable  to  detect  the  virus
about 20% of the time. 

You'll  find  this  word  showing  up  in  discussions  of  eyewitness  testimony  at  crime  scenes,  of  lie
detectors, and of critical airplane parts. Some of us are most familiar with the fallibility of memory,
especially when we remember something clearly that turns out never to have happened. Being fallible
is part of being human, and sometimes the biggest errors are made by those who are thought of as the
most brilliant of all.

- [[infallible]] 
properly or succeed. 

  (1)  Not  capable  of  being  wrong  or  making  mistakes.  (2)  Certain  to  work

• Two college friends of mine claimed to have an infallible system for beating the odds at roulette in
Las Vegas. 

Watch out when you hear about infallible predictions, an infallible plan, an infallible cure, or even
infallible  lip  gloss.  Infallible  isn't  a  claim  that  scientists,  engineers,  and  doctors  like  to  make,  so
you're  probably  getting  better  information  when  the  word  not  comes  first.  You  may  have  heard  the
phrase  “papal  infallibility,”  which  refers  to  the  official  position  of  the  Roman  Catholic  church,
adopted in the 19th century, that certain solemn statements made by a Pope about faith or morals were
not to be questioned. Popes since then have been careful not to make many of these statements.
