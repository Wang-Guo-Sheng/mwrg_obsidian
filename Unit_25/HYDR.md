- HYDR flows from the Greek word for “water.” The “water” root can be found in the lovely flower
called the hydrangea: its seed capsules resemble ancient Greek water vessels.

- [[hydraulic]] 
(2) Operated by the resistance or pressure of liquid forced through a small opening or tube. 

 (1) Relating to water; operated, moved, or brought about by means of water.

•  Without  any  hydraulic  engineers,  the  country  is  unlikely  to  build  many  dams  or  reservoirs  on  its
own. 

By means of a hydraulic lift, the driver can lift the bed of a dump truck with the touch of a button. He
might also repair the hydraulic steering, the hydraulic brake, or the hydraulic clutch—all of which,
like the lift that holds everything up, take advantage of the way liquids act under pressure. Somewhat
like a pulley or a lever, a hydraulic system magnifies the effect of moderate pressure exerted over a
longer distance into powerful energy for a shorter distance.

- [[dehydrate]] 

 (1) To remove water from. (2) To deprive of energy and zest. 

• The boy appeared at dusk staggering out of the desert, dangerously sunburned and dehydrated. 

Dehydrating  food  is  a  good  way  to  preserve  it;  raisins,  which  are  dehydrated  grapes,  are  a  good
example. Dehydration through industrial processes makes it possible to keep food even longer and
store  it  in  a  smaller  space.  Freeze-drying  produces  food  that  only  needs  rehydration—that  is,  the
addition  of  water—to  restore  its  original  consistency.  Runners,  cyclists,  and  hikers  fearful  of
dehydration seem to be constantly hydrating themselves nowadays, sometimes even using a shoulder
pack  with  a  tube  going  straight  into  the  mouth.  Dehydrate  can  also  be  used  for  making  something
“dry” or “lifeless”; thus, a dull teacher can dehydrate American history, and an unimaginative staging
can dehydrate a great Shakespeare play.

- [[hydroelectric]] 

 Having to do with the production of electricity by waterpower. 

• A massive African hydroelectric project is creating the world's largest manmade lake, and is said to
hold the key to the future for the country. 

The prime component of most hydroelectric systems is a dam. A high dam funnels water downward at
high  pressure  to  spin  turbines,  which  in  turn  drive  generators  to  produce  high-voltage  electricity.
Mountainous  countries  with  rushing  rivers  can  produce  the  most  hydroelectricity.  Though
hydroelectricity comes from a clean and completely renewable energy source, dams disrupt natural
systems in a way that disturbs environmentalists.

- [[hydroponics]] 
supporting substances such as sand or gravel. 

  The  growing  of  plants  in  nutrient  solutions,  with  or  without

•  He  had  never  thought  hydroponics  produced  vegetables  as  tasty  as  those  grown  in  soil,  and  the
tomatoes seemed particularly disappointing. 

Hydroponics, also known as aquaculture or tank farming, began as a way of studying scientifically
the  mechanisms  of  plant  nutrition.  Hydroponically  grown  plants  may  have  no  solid  material  under
them at all; instead, their roots often simply hang in water with a rich mix of nutrients dissolved in it.
The principal advantage to hydroponics is the savings from reduced labor costs, since it's generally
carried  on  in  enclosed  areas  and  the  irrigation  and  fertilizing  are  done  mechanically.  Peppers,
cucumbers, and various other vegetables are produced hydroponically in huge quantities.

- Greek and Latin Borrowings

aegis 
individual or organization. 

  (1)  Something  that  protects  or  defends;  shield.  (2)  Sponsorship  or  guidance  by  an

• The conference was held under the aegis of the World Affairs Council, which provided almost all of
the funding. 

The original aegis was a goatskin shield or breastplate, symbolizing majesty, that was worn by Zeus
and his daughter Athena in Greek mythology. Athena's aegis bore the severed head of the monstrous
Medusa. Aegis came to be used for any kind of invulnerable shield. But today we almost always use
the word in the phrase “under the aegis of . . . ,” which means “under the authority, sponsorship, or
control of.”

- [[charisma]] 
enthusiasm. (2) A special ability to attract or charm; magnetism. 

  (1)  An  extraordinary  gift  for  leadership  that  attracts  popular  support  and

• Many later leaders have envied the charisma of Napoleon Bonaparte, who many of his followers
genuinely believed to be immortal. 

Charisma  is  Greek  for  “gift,”  but  its  traditional  meaning  comes  from  Christian  belief,  where  it
originally  referred  to  an  extraordinary  power—the  gift  of  healing,  the  gift  of  tongues,  or  the  gift  of
prophecy—bestowed  on  an  individual  by  the  Holy  Spirit.  The  first  nonreligious  use  of  charisma
didn't appear until the 20th century, when it was applied to that mysterious personal magnetism that a
lucky few seem to possess, especially the magnetism with which a political leader can arouse great
popular  enthusiasm.  When  John  F.  Kennedy  was  elected  president  in  1960,  its  use  by  journalists
popularized  the  term  in  the  mass  media.  Since  then,  actors,  rock  stars,  athletes,  generals,  and
entrepreneurs have all been said to possess charisma.

- [[ego]] 
sense of self-importance. 

  (1)  A  sense  of  confidence  and  satisfaction  in  oneself;  self-esteem.  (2)  An  exaggerated

• His raging ego was what his fellow lawyers remembered about him—his tantrums, his vanity, his
snobbery, and all the rest of it. 

Ego is the Latin word for “I.“ So if a person seems to begin every sentence with “I,” it's sometimes a
sign of a big ego. It was the psychologist Sigmund Freud (well, actually his original translator) who
put  ego  into  the  popular  vocabulary,  but  what  he  meant  by  the  word  is  complex,  so  only  other
psychologists  really  use  it  in  the  Freudian  sense.  The  rest  of  us  generally  use  ego  simply  to  mean
one's sense of self-worth, whether exaggerated or not. When used in the “exaggerated” sense, ego is
almost the same thing as conceit. Meeting a superstar athlete without a trace of this kind of ego would
be a most refreshing experience. But having a reasonable sense of your own worth is no sin. Life's
little everyday victories are good—in fact, necessary—for a healthy ego.

- [[ethos]] 
an institution. 

 The features, attitudes, moral code, or basic beliefs that define a person, a group, or

• The company's ethos has always been an interesting blend of greed and generosity. 

Ethos means “custom” or “character” in Greek. As originally used by Aristotle, it referred to a man's
character or personality, especially in its balance between passion and caution. Today ethos is used
to refer to the practices or values that distinguish one person, organization, or society from others. So
we often hear of the ethos of rugged individualism and self-sufficiency on the American frontier in the
19th century; and a critic might complain about, for example, the ethos of violence in the inner cities
or the ethos of permissiveness in the suburbs.

- [[hubris]] 

 Unreasonable or unjustified pride or self-confidence. 

• Two hours later, the team's boastful pregame hubris bumped into the embarrassing reality of defeat. 

To  the  Greeks,  hubris  referred  to  extreme  pride,  especially  pride  and  ambition  so  great  that  they
offend the gods and lead to one's downfall. Hubris was a character flaw often seen in the heroes of
classical Greek tragedy, including Oedipus and Achilles. The familiar old saying “Pride goeth before
a fall” is basically talking about hubris.

- [[id]] 

 The part of a person's unconscious mind that relates to basic needs and desires. 

•  His  own  id  often  scared  him,  especially  when  a  sudden  violent  impulse  would  well  up  out  of
nowhere. 

In Latin, id means simply “it.” Sigmund Freud (and his translator) brought the word into the modern
vocabulary as the name of what Freud believed to be one of the three basic elements of the human
personality, the other two being the ego (see ego) and the superego. According to Freud, the id is the
first of these to develop, and is the home of the body's basic instincts, particularly those involving sex
and  aggression.  Since  the  id  lacks  logic,  reason,  or  even  organization,  it  can  contain  conflicting
impulses.  Primitive  in  nature,  it  wants  to  be  satisfied  immediately.  Although  its  workings  are
completely unconscious, Freud believed that its contents could be revealed in works of art, in slips of
the tongue (“Freudian slips”), and in one's dreams.

- [[libido]] 
primitive biological urges and is usually goal-oriented. 

  (1)  Sexual  drive.  (2)  In  psychoanalytic  theory,  energy  that  is  derived  from

• She would sit at home trying not to think about where his unmanageable libido had led him this time.

The Latin word libido, meaning “desire, lust,” was borrowed by Sigmund Freud as the name for a
concept in his own theories. At first he defined libido to mean the instinctual energy associated with
the sex drive. Later he broadened the word's meaning and began using it to mean the mental energy
behind purposeful human activity of any kind; in other words, the libido (for which Freud also used
the term eros, a Greek word meaning “sexual love”) came to be regarded as the life instinct, which
included sex along with all the other impulses we rely on to keep us alive. But those of us who aren't
psychologists use the word simply as a synonym for “sex drive.”

- [[trauma]] 
mental or emotional stress or physical injury. 

 (1) A serious injury to the body. (2) An abnormal psychological state caused by

•  Fifteen  years  later,  their  adopted  Cambodian  daughter  was  still  having  nightmares  in  which  she
relived the trauma of those terrible years. 

Trauma is the Greek word for “wound.” Although the Greeks used the term only for physical injuries,
nowadays trauma is just as likely to refer to emotional wounds. We now know that a traumatic event
can  leave  psychological  symptoms  long  after  any  physical  injuries  have  healed.  The  psychological
reaction to emotional trauma now has an established name: post-traumatic stress disorder, or PTSD.
It  usually  occurs  after  an  extremely  stressful  event,  such  as  wartime  combat,  a  natural  disaster,  or
sexual  or  physical  abuse;  its  symptoms  include  depression,  anxiety,  flashbacks,  and  recurring
nightmares.
