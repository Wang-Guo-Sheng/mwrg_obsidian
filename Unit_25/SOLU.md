- SOLU comes from the Latin verb solvere, “to loosen, free, release,” and the root therefore may take
the form solv- [[as]] well. So to solve a problem means to find its solution, as if you were freeing up a
logjam. And a solvent is a chemical that dissolves or “loosens up” oil or paint.

- [[soluble]] 
explained. 

 (1) Able to be dissolved in a liquid, especially water. (2) Able to be solved or

• To an optimistic young principal, the problems of a school like this one might seem challenging but
soluble. 

Soluble  looks  like  a  word  that  should  be  confined  to  chemistry  labs,  though  it's  often  used  by
nonchemists as well to describe substances that can be dissolved in liquids. On the other hand, the
sense of soluble meaning “solvable” is also quite common. In this sense, soluble, like its opposite,
insoluble, is usually paired with problem. If only all life's problems were soluble by stirring them in
a container filled with water.

- [[absolution]] 

 The act of forgiving someone for their sins. 

• Every week she would kneel to confess her little sins and receive absolution from the priest. 

Since the Latin absolutus meant “set free,” it's easy to see how absolution came to mean “set free
from sin.” (And also easy to see why absolute means basically “pure”—that is, originally, “free of
sin.”) The verb for absolution is absolve. Just as a priest absolves believers of their sins, you may
absolve your brother of blame for a household disaster, or you yourself may in time be absolved for
that scrape on the car backing out of a parking space.

- [[dissolution]] 
as through disruption or decay. 

 The act or process of breaking down or apart into basic components,

• The dissolution of the U.S.S.R. was probably the most momentous event of the last quarter of the
20th century. 

Dissolution is the noun form of dissolve, but it's a much less common word. Still, we refer to the fact
that the dissolution of American marriages became far more common in the later 20th century. Or that
when India won its independence in 1948, the dissolution of the once-global British empire was all
but  complete.  Or  that  factors  such  as  crime  and  drugs  might  be  contributing  to  the  dissolution  of
contemporary  society's  moral  fabric.  A  dissolute  person  is  someone  in  whom  all  restraint  has
dissolved, and who now indulges in behavior that shocks decent people.

- [[resolute]] 

 Marked by firm determination. 

• After ten years of indecision, the Senate finally seems resolute about reaching an agreement. 

Resolute comes from the same Latin verb as resolved, and the two words are often synonyms. So how
did it get this meaning from the Latin? Essentially, when you resolve a question or problem, you come
to a conclusion, and once you've reached a conclusion you can proceed to act. So in your New Year's
resolutions,  you  resolve—or  make  up  your  mind—to  do  something.  Unfortunately,  New  Year's
resolutions aren't a good illustration of the meaning of resolute, since only about one in ten actually
seems to succeed.

- HYDR flows from the Greek word for “water.” The “water” root can be found in the lovely flower
