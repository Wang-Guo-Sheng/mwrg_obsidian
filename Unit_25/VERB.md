VERB comes from the Latin verbum, meaning “word.” A verb—or action word—appears in some
form in every complete sentence. To express something verbally—or to verbalize something—is to
say it or write it.

- [[verbose]] 

 Using more words than are needed; wordy. 

•  The  writing  style  in  government  publications  has  often  been  both  dry  and  verbose—a  deadly
combination. 

Americans brought up on fast-paced TV shows and action films have lost any patience they once had
for verbosity. So most American writing is brisk, and American speakers usually don't waste many
words. But many of us love our own voices and opinions and don't realize we're being verbose until
our listeners start stifling their yawns. And students still try to fill up the pages of their term papers
with unneeded verbosity.

- [[proverb]] 
observation. 

  A  brief,  often-repeated  statement  that  expresses  a  general  truth  or  common

• “Waste not, want not” used to be a favorite proverb in many households. 

Proverbs  probably  appeared  with  the  dawn  of  language.  Sayings  such  as  “A  stitch  in  time  saves
nine,” or “Pride goeth before a fall,” or “Least said, soonest mended,” or “To everything there is a
season”  are  easily  memorized  nuggets  of  wisdom.  But  the  convenient  thing  about  proverbs  is  that
there's  often  one  for  every  point  of  view.  For  every  “Look  before  you  leap”  there's  a  “He  who
hesitates is lost.” “A fool and his money are soon parted” can be countered with “To make money you
have  to  spend  money.”  A  cynic  once  observed,  “Proverbs  are  invaluable  treasures  to  dunces  with
good memories.”

- [[verbatim]] 

 In the exact words; word for word. 

• It turned out that the writer had lifted long passages verbatim from an earlier, forgotten biography of
the statesman. 

Verbatim  comes  directly  from  Latin  into  English  with  the  same  spelling  and  meaning.  Memorizing
famous speeches, poems, or literary passages is a good way to both train the memory and absorb the
classic  texts  of  our  literature  and  culture.  At  one  time  the  ability  to  recite  verbatim  the  Gettysburg
Address, the beginning of the Declaration of Independence, and great speeches from Shakespeare was
the mark of a well-educated person. But when that language was quoted by a writer, he or she was
always careful to put quotation marks around it and tell readers who the true author was.

- [[verbiage]] 

 An excess of words, often with little content; wordiness. 

• The agency's report was full of unnecessary verbiage, which someone should have edited out before
the report was published. 

Government reports are notorious for their unfortunate tendency toward empty verbiage, through part
of the reason is simply that officials are anxious to be following all the rules. Legal documents are
also generally full of verbiage, partly because lawyers want to be sure that every last possibility has
been covered and no loopholes have been left. But writing that contains unneeded verbiage is often
trying  to  disguise  its  lack  of  real  substance  or  clarity  of  thought.  And  every  writer,  including
government  workers  and  lawyers,  should  be  constantly  on  the  lookout  for  opportunities  to  hit  the
Delete key.

- SIMIL/SIMUL come from the Latin adjective similis, meaning “like, resembling, similar,” and the
