自恋狂

 Someone who is extremely self-centered and ignores the problems and concerns of others. 

• He's a completely unimpressive  (不起眼的) person, but that doesn't keep him from being an egomaniac. 

Ego is Latin for “I,” and in English ego usually means “sense of self-worth.” Most people's egos stay
at a healthy level, but some become exaggerated. Egomaniacs may display a **grandiose** (夸口的) sense of **self-importance**,  with  **fantasies**  about  their  own brilliance  or  beauty,  intense  **envy**  of  others,  a  lack  of sympathy, and a need to be adored or feared. But, like megalomaniac, the word egomaniac is thrown around by lots of people who don't mean much more by it than *blowhard* or *know-it-all*.
